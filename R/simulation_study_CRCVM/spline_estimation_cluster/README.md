Execute run_DistanceShore.sh to perform simulation study for a CRCVM with DistanceShore covariate on the clusters.
You will need to specify :
- the .txt file containing hyperparameters of the simulation study
- the number of simulations, that is the number of batch of trajectories that we use to assess our method on each domain.
- the number of jobs per batch of submission to the clusters (maximum 50 jobs at a time on dahu).
