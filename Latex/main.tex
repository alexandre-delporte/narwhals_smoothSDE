\section{Introduction}



%context and literature review, objective of the paper, new contributions
% ARCTIC , narwhals etc
Assessment of human disturbance on animal behaviour has become a major concern in the ecology community. Both instantaneous and long-term changes in animal behaviour have been studied by taking advantage of the large amount of wildlife data now available. One of the commonly accepted method to analyse such behavioural changes due to human activities is to perform "controlled exposure experiments". Animals are exposed to disturbances in a precise and monitored set up where different  statistics can be measured: GPS positions, sound exposure level, temperature, pressure, heart beat, stroke rate...  
Several studies involving beaked whales \parencite{tyack_beaked_2011}, common sole larvaes \parencite{bolle_common_2012}, narwhals \parencite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021} and many other species have already been done. Marine mammals are particularly challenging to track since GPS data can only be retrieved when they emerge at the surface of the sea and a satellite is near enough. Moreover, some species can dive at great depth, so that the equipment must keep working in such extreme environment \parencite{cioffi_trade-offs_nodate}. In this paper, a data-set of east Greenland narwhals's movement under controlled exposure experiments will be analysed. \\



As a consequence of climate change and decrease in sea ice coverage, the Greenland ecosystem is likely to be more and more exposed to anthropogenic activity in the next decades \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021}. Shipping activities as well as sonar and seismic surveys are a few instances of new disturbances that could alter animals's habits.  Hence, there is an urge for more knowledge about the impact this could have on endemic species such as the narwhals. This marine mammal is one of the most sensitive to sound exposure as it uses echolocation to orient itself beneath the water \cite{tervo_narwhals_2021}. Moreover, recent studies showed that the population of narwahls in Southeast Greenland is already in decline \cite{garde_biological_2022}. The effects of sound and ship exposure on its diving and foraging behaviour have already been the subject of several studies \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021,ngo_understanding_2019}. However, their horizontal movement has for now been analyzed with discrete time methods such as Markov chains  \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021}. A covariate representing the level of sound received by the narwhals was used to model the transition probabilities of the Markov Chain, and it was concluded that narwhals effectively tried to avoid the ship by moving fast toward the shore.\textcolor{red}{add more detailed explanations}. Here, we use a continuous time model to analyse the GPS positions and try to corroborate this analysis. The objective is to be able to quantify  the effect of sound exposure on different characteristics of the movement.\\


We propose to use a stochastic differential equation with varying coefficient to model the GPS tracks of the individuals. The continuous time correlated random walk (also known as integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck, or correlated velocity model) that has been introduced in \cite{johnson_continuous_2008} is one of the most common model one can find in the literature to analyse such data. It has been  widely used in ecology to model 2D animal movement \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017,albertsen_generalizing_2019} \textcolor{red}{add more references}, and even 3D movement \cite{gurarie_estimating_2011}.

 Following \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017}, this model can be written
\begin{equation} \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		dv(t)=-\frac{1}{\tau} (v(t) -\mu)dt+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} dW(t) \\
		dx(t)=v(t) dt
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: CVM equation}
\end{equation}
$v(t)$ is the horizontal 2D velocity at time $t$ and $x(t)$ is the position, typically in longitude and latitude or in UTM coordinates. $W(t)$ is a $2$ dimensional brownian motion. 
The parameter $\tau$ is an autocorrelation time scale, $\nu$ controls the norm of the velocity and drives how much random variability there is in the velocity vector, and $\mu$ is the long term velocity. This equation is a special case of velocity potential model, where the potential is a second degree polynomial \cite{preisler_analyzing_2013}. \\


In general, the motion of marine mammals is subject to spatial constraints induced by the coastline. This is particularly the case for the narwhal data we want to analyse : the animals move in a complex system of fjords in Scoresby Sound (East Greenland), imposing strong constraints on the location process. However, this phenomenon is not taken into account in model~\ref{eq: CVM equation}, nor in most of the SDE used in the context of animal movement \cite{johnson_continuous_2008,michelot_varying-coefficient_2021,gurarie_correlated_2017}. 
Recent papers including constraints are \cite{hanks_reflected_2017} and \cite{russell_spatially_2018}.
 In \cite{hanks_reflected_2017}, a reflected version of the CVM is considered to study sea lion telemetry data.
For the simulation, points ending up in land are projected on the coastline.  Estimation of the SDE parameters relies on computationally intensive MCMC algorithm (Metroplis-Hastings), and requires high frequency data. This requirement is met by linearly interpolating between the discrete time observations of the process.
In \cite{russell_spatially_2018}, a repulsive potential function is used to constrain ants movement within a box.
Usually, the way to model the motion of an animal near the boundary of the domain should be species-specific, accounting for the particular behaviors and spatial use of the studied animal \cite{brillinger_simulating_2003}. For the narwhals, it was concluded from the data that they have a proclivity to move along the shoreline. Here we propose a new model based on the following simple idea : as the narwhals approach the shore, at some point they need to rotate to avoid or align with the shoreline.


To add a rotational component, we propose to use the rotational version of the CVM \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017,albertsen_generalizing_2019}.
\begin{equation} \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		dv(t)=-A(v(t)-\mu)dt+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} dW(t) \\
		dx(t)=v(t) dt
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: RACVM equation}
\end{equation}
where $A=\begin{pmatrix} 
	\frac{1}{\tau} & -\omega \\
	\omega & \frac{1}{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}$.
The new parameter $\omega$ is an angular velocity that controls how fast the velocity vector should rotate. Notice that if $\omega=0$ this is simply equation \ref{eq: CVM equation}.

The novelty of this paper consists in estimating the parameters $\tau$ and $\omega$ as smooth functions of the distance to the boundary and the angle between the animal's direction and the boundary normal vector. This is a way to make the drift in the velocity equation dependent on the location process $x$. \\
Such a model can be estimated in the framework of the \texttt{R} package \texttt{smoothSDE}. To make this possible, we formulated a state-space model by binding the velocity and location in one single hidden state vector, following \cite{johnson_continuous_2008}. Maximum likelihood estimation based on Kalman filter is then performed as for any other model in \texttt{smoothSDE}.

On top of this, the parameter $\nu$ will be estimated as a smooth function of a sound exposure covariate defined as the inverse of the distance to the ship.
The effect of sound exposure is assessed both in the constrained and unconstrained frameworks.



To summarize, the main contributions of this paper are
\begin{itemize}
	\item Derivation of a state-space model for the RACVM defined in \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017}, and addition of this method in the framework of \texttt{smoothSDE}, to enable the use of smooth parameters $\nu$,$\tau$,$\omega$ and $\mu$, and estimation from noisy observations irregularly spaced in time.
	\item Definition of a Constrained Rotational Correlated Velocity Model (CRCVM) for simulation study. Deviations angles from shoreline and distance to shore are used as covariates to constrain the movement within a polygon, and align the velocity with the boundary of the domain.
	\item Application to real narwhal data to asess a behavioural response of the narwhals, using the exposure covariate defined as the inverse of the Distance to the ship.
\end{itemize}

Note that simpler SDE models as Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck with varying coefficient already proved to be convenient at assessing behavioural responses by examining deviation from a baseline model that represents the animal behaviour under normal conditions. For instance, it was used in \cite{michelot_continuous-time_2022} to estimate avoidance behaviours of beaked whales after exposure to military sonar systems.


Eventually, while a lot of results are known about the existence and properties of constrained diffusions, their application in the context of animal motion remains relatively underdeveloped \cite{brillinger_simulating_2003}. This text aims to contribute to bridging this gap.

\section{Movement data of Greenland endemic narwhals}
%describe how the data was obtained, the geography, type of whales, year, exposure to boats etc..
%trajectory plots, coordinate system, trial, intertrial; gunsize, tagtime
The dataset analysed in this paper has already been the subject of several studies, focusing mainly on the diving behaviour of the narwhals \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021,tervo_narwhals_2021,ngo_understanding_2019}. 
Six male narwhals were equipped with FastLoc GPS receivers in August 2018 in Scoresby Sound fjord system in East Greenland by biologists from the Greenland Institute of natural ressources, with the help of local Inuit hunters. The Scoresby Sound fjord system
is known to be the summer residence for an isolated population of narwhals.
Here we recall briefly how the data has been retrieved. For more details about the study area and the tagging of the animals, the reader may refer to \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021}. 
An offshore patrol vessel military ship was sailed to shoot airguns underwater between August 25 and September 1. It was equipped with two Sercel G-guns at 6m depth and moved at a speed of 4.5 knots. The guns were fired synchronously every 80 s,
and the GPS navigation system recorded the
location of every shot. 
Data includes narwhals's latitude and longitude, distance of the narwhals relative to the ship in metres, GPS time, distance to the shore in metres. GPS positions are known only at specific times when the narwhals get close to the sea surface. The median time step between two GPS measurements in the data is about $5$ minutes and only $0.3 \%$ of the time steps reach more than two hours, with a maximum at more than $4$ hours.\textcolor{red}{add histograms of time steps}\\

Experiments were divided into unexposed periods - for which the narwhals are not in line of sight with the ship - trial periods - when the narwhals are exposed to the ship and airguns are shot - and intertrial periods - when the narwhals are exposed to the ship but airguns are not shot. These periods are indicated by a categorical variable $T_{ship}$ in the dataset. Figure~\ref{fig: trials and intertrials distributions} shows how these periods are distributed among the $6$ narwhals that were tracked.

    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{images/data_exploration/trials.png}
    \caption{Trial and Intertrial periods for each narwhal}
    \label{fig: trials and intertrials distributions}
\end{figure}

For each narwhal, the entire track was separated into a period before exposure defined as the period before the narwhal gets in line of sight with the ship for the first time, and a period during exposure, after the narwhal has been in line of sight with the ship for the first time. We kept only GPS measures 24 
hours after tagging, to avoid any tagging effects on the narwhals's movement, as recommended in \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021}.
Measures that resulted in a velocity higher than $20$ km/h were also discarded (only 2 data points for the same narwhal track).
Overall, $4192$ GPS positions were kept for the analysis and projected to UTM coordinates zone 26. The splitting between data before and after exposure resulted in $935$ measures before exposure and $3257$ measures after exposure. Table~\ref{table: data distribution} shows how the data is distributed among the different narwhals. Figure~\ref{fig: tracks before and after exposure} shows all the tracks before and during exposure.

The land geometry for this specific region in South-East Greenland was gathered from \href{https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/70.4029/-27.2928}{OpenStreetMap} database.
For each GPS measurement time $t_j$, the nearest point $p(t_j)$ on the shoreline was computed and the distance to the shore was determined as the distance to this point. The resulting values range from $0$ to $7.5$ km. About $9\%$ of the GPS measurements in the dataset turned out to be on land. This was primarily attributed to inaccuracies in the shoreline maps rather than errors in GPS measurements. For constrained movement models, these points were ignored. Then, the exposure to shore covariate was defined with the following formula
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
	 E_{shore}=0 & \mbox{if } D_{shore}>D_0 \\
	E_{shore}=\frac{1}{D_{shore}} & \mbox{if } D_{shore} < D_0
\end{array}
\right.
\label{eq: exp shore definition}
\end{equation}
where the threshold $D_0$ was chosen equal to $0.5$ km.
The angle between the narwhal's heading and the shoreline was computed as the angle $\theta$ between each step vector $x(t_j+\Delta_j)-x(t_j)$ and the vector $n(t_j)=x(t_j)-p(t_j)$. This is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig: illustration nearest shore points}. A value $\Theta=\pm \frac{\pi}{2}$ indicates movement parallel to the shore, while $\Theta \in \left]\frac{\pi}{2},\pi\right] \cup \left[-\pi,\frac{-\pi}{2}\right[$ indicates movement toward the shore. 
The distance from the ship was computed from the GPS ship and narwhals's positions. The values are comprised between $2.68$ and $63.8$ km.
Histograms of the distance to the ship and the distance to the shore are shown in figure~\ref{fig: distance to shore and distance to ship histograms}. The covariates $E_{shore}$ and $\Theta$ will only be used in the constrained SDE models.

The exposure to ship covariate was defined as the inverse of the distance to the ship (in km) \cite{heide-jorgensen_behavioral_2021}.
$D_{ship}$ is not known when the narwhal is not in line of sight with the boat, so that exposures are set to $0$ in this case. The closer the narwhal is to the ship, the greater the exposure. This is a proxy for sound exposure levels received by the narwhals. Exposure levels for each narwhals are displayed in figure~\ref{fig: realexpthroughtime}.All the covariates that will be used for the analysis of narwhals movement are summarized in table \ref{tab: covariates}.

\section{Diffusion models}

\subsection{Rotational correlated velocity model (RCVM)}
\label{section: RCVM}

The more general equation for a rotational correlated velocity model is \cite{albertsen_generalizing_2019}:

\begin{equation} \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		dv(t)=-A(v(t)-\mu)dt+\Sigma dW(t) \\
		dx(t)=v(t) dt
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: general RACVM equation}
\end{equation}
where $A=\begin{pmatrix} 
	\frac{1}{\tau_1} & -\omega \\
	\omega & \frac{1}{\tau_2}
\end{pmatrix}$.
Here, $\Sigma$ is a lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements whereas $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are two autocorrelations time scale for each component of the velocity. This model is indeed a special case of hypoelliptic diffusion \cite{ditlevsen_hypoelliptic_2018}.
There is an explicit form for the gaussian transition density of the velocity process \cite{albertsen_generalizing_2019}, where the covariance matrix is expressed using a Kronecker sum.

It is commonly assumed that the movement is isotropic, forcing $\tau_1=\tau_2=\tau$, and that the random changes in both components of the velocity are independent with the same variance, in which case $\Sigma=\sigma^2 I_2$.
This diffusion parameter $\sigma$ is written as $\sigma=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\tau \pi}}$ to give biological meaning to the parameters \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017}.These simplifications produce the equation~\ref{eq: RACVM equation}.

When parameters $\tau$, $\mu$ and $\nu$ are constant over time, both the velocity and the position processes can be solved explicitly.
The transition density for the velocity process is such that 
\begin{equation}v(t+\Delta) \vert v(t)=v \sim \mathcal{N}\left( (I_2-\exp(-A\Delta))\mu + \exp(-A\Delta)v, \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}(1-e^{-2\frac{\Delta}{\tau}}) I_2 \right) 
\end{equation}


Note that $\exp(-A\Delta)=e^{\frac{-\Delta}{\tau}} \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\omega \Delta) & \sin(\omega \Delta) \\ -\sin(\omega \Delta) & \cos(\omega \Delta) \end{pmatrix}$ is a rotation matrix of angle $-\omega \Delta$.
Intuitively, the next velocity is a weighted mean of the long term mean velocity $\mu$ and the previous velocity $v(t)$ rotated by an angle $-\omega \Delta$.


%stationary distribution, distribution of the norm, distribution of the phase
The stationary distribution of the velocity process is $\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} I_2\right)$. This result can be used to get the long term distribution of the velocity norm and the velocity phase angle. After the velocity process has reached stationarity, that is typically for $t \geq 3\tau$, $\vert \vert v(t) \vert \vert$ follows a Rice distribution with mean parameter $\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert$ and variance parameter $\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}$. In the special case $\mu=(0,0)$, this means that $\E(\vert \vert v(t) \vert \vert)=\nu$. Hence, the order of magnitude of the parameter $\nu$ can be deduced from the data by computing the overall mean empirical velocity norm. The distribution of the phase angle $\Phi$ of the velocity has been derived in \cite{pawula_phase_1982}.
When $\mu=0$, this distribution is uniform over $[-\pi,\pi]$. Hence, taking a look at the histograms of the phase angle of the data can help to assess whether a non zero mean velocity is necessary in the model or not.

Then, by integrating the velocity equation over time one gets the transition density of the location process.
\begin{equation}
	x(t+\Delta) \vert x(t)=x, v(t)=v \sim \mathcal{N}\left(x+\mu \Delta+A^{-1} \left( I_2-\exp(-A\Delta)\right)(v-\mu),Q(\Delta)\right)  
\end{equation}
Here, the covariance matrix $Q(\Delta)$ has an explicit form.

\[
	Q(\Delta)=\left( \Delta-2 \frac{\omega \sin(\omega \Delta)-\frac{1}{\tau} \cos(\omega \Delta)}{\frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2 } \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta}{\tau} \right) +\frac{\tau}{2} \left( \frac{\omega^2-\frac{3}{\tau^2}}{\frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2}-\exp\left( -\frac{2\Delta}{\tau}\right)\right) \right) I_2
\]
Note that the position process is not markovian, only the whole process $(x(t), v(t))^\top$ is markovian.
Remark that both components of the location and velocity processes are independent.
One can check that for $\omega=0$, the formulas match the one of the CTCRW model \cite{johnson_continuous_2008}. Figure~\ref{fig: sample RACVM} shows two samples of a RCVM along with the histograms of the empirical velocity norm and phase. Derivation of the formulas given in this paragraph is detailed in appendix~\ref{section: detailed RACVM computations}.\\

\subsection{Constrained rotational correlated velocity model}
\label{section: CRCVM}

To get a constrained version of the CVM, it is natural to make use of a RCVM when the process is close to the shore and the velocity is pointing toward the shore to represent how the animals turn in reaction to the shore.
This can be achieved by choosing a smooth function that is zero far away from the shore and non zero close to the shore for $\omega$.
Denote $\mathcal{D} \subset \R^2$ the domain of the process $x$.
\begin{equation} \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		dv(t)=-A(x(t),v(t))v(t)dt+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} dW(t) \\
		dx(t)=v(t) dt
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: CRCVM equation}
\end{equation}

Here, $A(x(t),v(t))=\begin{pmatrix} 
	\frac{1}{\tau} & -\omega(D_{shore}(t),\Theta(t)) \\
	\omega(D_{shore}(t),\Theta(t)) & \frac{1}{\tau}
\end{pmatrix}$
with $D_{shore}(t)=d(x(t),\mathcal{D})$,
 $\Theta(t)=\widehat{(x(t)-p(t),v(t))}$ and $p(t)$ is the projection of $x(t)$ on $\partial \mathcal{D}$.
 
 Solving explicitly such a model is out of reach due to the non linearity induced by the distance to the shore and the angle, but it is possible to get an approximate solution.
 For any $t \geq 0$ and $\Delta>0$, if $\Delta$ is small enough, then we can use the rough approximations
 \[\forall s \in [t,t+\Delta], D_{shore}(s) \simeq D_{shore}(t) \quad \Theta(s)\simeq \Theta(t)\]
 In this case, the formulas of section~\ref{section: RCVM} are still valid.
 The question still hanging is : what are the conditions on the function $\omega(D_{shore},\Theta)$ to ensure that the process is constrained ?
 We don't formulate a comprehensive answer here, but only give examples of interpretable smooth functions that result in constrained samples of $x$ (see section \ref{section: simulation study}).
 An important spatial scale of the rotational movement is $\rho=\frac{\nu}{\omega}$ : this is the diameter of rotation. For the process to be constrained, one condition would be that $\rho$ always remains significantly lower than $D_{shore}$. Moreover, a rotation should be considered only for some specific values of the angle $\Theta$, more precisely $\Theta \in \left[\frac{\pi}{2},\pi\right] \cup \left[-\pi,-\frac{\pi}{2}\right]$, that is when the narwhal is heading in the direction of the shore.\\ 
 
 Note that this general model is very flexible, and different species-specific behaviours could be described. For the narwhals, a tendency to move along the shore could be considered by specifying a function $\omega$ that is non zero even when $\Theta \in \left[\frac{\pi}{2}-\varepsilon,\frac{\pi}{2}\right] \cup \left[-\frac{\pi}{2},-\frac{\pi}{2}+\varepsilon\right]$, so that when the animal would be on the verge of leaving the shore, its velocity would be tweaked to align with the shoreline. It is also possible  to specify $\tau$ similarly as a function of $D_{shore}$ and $\Theta$ to model specific behaviour near the shore (e.g higher persistence along the shoreline).\\

\subsection{Ship exposure effect}
\label{subsection: ship exposure effect}


%WHY TENSOR SPLINES : because covariates THeta and Eshore are not on the same scale, and identity link function
% FOR TAU: this makes sense to use additive splines since the link function is log
To assess if the exposure to the ship has a significative effect on the narwhals movement, we first fit a baseline model only on the data before exposure, to get an estimation on how the narwhals move when they are not exposed to the disturbance. Then, we fit a model on the data during exposure and check whether the estimated smooth parameters deviate significatively from the baseline values. We present here the more general baseline and response models. For practical work, they shall be simplified to make estimations more reliable.\\

For the baseline model, only the effect of the shore is included, as discussed in section~\ref{section: CRCVM}. To do this, we propose to use the shore exposure covariate $E_{shore}$, defined as the inverse of the distance to the shore, and the angle $\Theta$.
Moreover, although individuals have a tendency to move in the same way, their movement don't have exactly the same characteristics depending on their age and size for instance. This is taken into account by using a mixed effect model for the RCVM parameters.
For each narwhal $i \in \{1, \cdots, 6\}$, write $t_{exp}^{(i)}$ the first time when it gets in line of sight with the ship (start of exposure). Then for $t \leq t_{exp}^{(i)}$, that is before exposure to the ship, the narwhals motion processes $v^{(i)}(t)=\begin{pmatrix} v^{(i)}_1(t) & v^{(i)}_2(t) \end{pmatrix}^\top$ and $x^{(i)}(t)=\begin{pmatrix} x^{(i)}_1(t) & x^{(i)}_2(t) \end{pmatrix}^\top$ are supposed to solve equation~\ref{eq: CRCVM equation}. Because $\tau$ and $\nu$ can only be positive, a log link function is used for these parameters. The parameter $\omega$ is expressed as a smooth function of $\Theta$ and $D_{shore}$ through splines. Since both covariates are not on the same scale (one is in $rad$ while the other is in $km$), tensor splines were judged more appropriate than thin plate regression splines.

\begin{equation} 
	\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
	
			\log(\tau^{(i)}(t))=\log(\tau_{pre})+b_{\tau,pre}^{(i)} \\
			\log(\nu^{(i)}(t))=\log(\nu_{pre})+b_{\nu,pre}^{(i)}  \\
			\omega^{(i)}(t)=\omega_{0,pre}+\sum_{k=1}^{q_E \times q_{\Theta}} \omega_{k,pre} \psi_k(E_{shore}^{(i)}(t),\Theta^{(i)}(t)) + b_{\omega,pre}^{(i)}
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: baseline model}
\end{equation}


$\log(\tau_{pre})$, $\log(\nu_{pre})$, $\omega_{0,pre}$ are unknown intercepts and $b^{(i)}_{pre}=\begin{pmatrix} b_{1,pre}^{(i)} & b_{2,pre}^{(i)} & b_{3,pre}^{(i)} \end{pmatrix}^\top \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, \diag\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_{pre}}\right)\right)$
where $\lambda_{pre}=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sigma_{\tau,pre}^2} & \frac{1}{\sigma_{\nu,pre}^2} & \frac{1}{\sigma_{\omega,pre}^2} \end{pmatrix}^\top$ and the variances $\sigma_{\tau,pre}^2$, $\sigma_{\nu,pre}^2$, $\sigma_{\omega,pre}^2$ are unknown.

The $\psi_k$ in equation~\ref{eq: baseline model} are  known bivariate cubic splines basis functions, constructed through tensor products from the univariate basis functions as described in \cite{wood_generalized_2017}, section 4.1.8.
\textcolor{red}{Add plot of the spline basis functions.}\\
The numbers of knots in the splines is $q_E-1$ and $q_{\Theta}-1$ for the respective covariates $E_{shore}$ and $\Theta$. It is needed to choose them before hand. One possibility to help choosing the best value is to increase the degree of freedom step by step  and find the value for which the decrease in AIC starts to get lower. \\
Based on the approximation that the covariates are constant on each time step $[t_j^{(i)},t_{j+1}^{(i)}]$, the parameters are piecewise constant.

\begin{equation} 
	\forall j \in \{1,\cdots, n_i\}
	 \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		
		\log(\tau^{(i)}_j)=\log(\tau_{pre})+b_{1,pre}^{(i)} \\
		\log(\nu^{(i)}_j)=\log(\nu_{pre})+b_{2,pre}^{(i)}  \\
		\omega^{(i)}_j=\omega_{0,pre}+\sum_{k=1}^{q_E \times q_{\Theta}} \omega_{k,pre} \psi_k(E_{shore}^{(i)}(t_j^{(i)}),\Theta^{(i)}(t_j^{(i)})) + b_{3,pre}^{(i)}
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: approximate baseline model}
\end{equation}


In matrix form equation~\ref{eq: approximate baseline model} can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{pre}= X_{pre} \beta_{pre}
	+Z_{pre}b_{pre}
\end{equation}

$\rho_{pre}$ is the vector of the parameter values on each time step, that has size $3n$ \[\rho_{pre}=\begin{pmatrix}
\log(\tau^{(1)}) & \cdots & \log(\tau^{(6)}) & \log(\nu^{(1)}) &
\cdots & \log(\nu^{(6)}) & \omega^{(1)}  &\cdots & \omega^{(6)}
\end{pmatrix}^\top\]
with $	\log(\tau^{(i)})=\begin{pmatrix} \log(\tau^{(i)}_1) & \cdots \log(\tau^{(i)}_{n_i})\end{pmatrix}$ and similarly for the $\log(\nu^{(i)})$ and $\omega^{(i)}$.
$X_{pre}$ and $Z_{pre}$ are respectively the fixed and random effects model matrices with sizes $3n \times (q_E\times q_{\Theta}+3)$ and $3n \times 18$.

$\beta_{pre}=\begin{pmatrix}
	\log(\tau_{pre}) &
	\log(\nu_{pre})  &
	\omega_{0,pre} &
	\omega_{1,pre} &
	\cdots & 
	\omega_{q_E q_{\Theta},pre}
\end{pmatrix}^\top$ is the vector of coefficients to estimate for the pre-exposure model and $b_{pre}=\begin{pmatrix}  b_{\tau,pre}^{(1)} &\cdots& b_{\tau,pre}^{(6)} &b_{\nu,pre}^{(1)}& \cdots & b_{\nu,pre}^{(6)} & b_{\omega,pre}^{(1)} & \cdots & b_{\omega,pre}^{(6)} \end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of random effects.\\

Then, the response model is designed to assess a deviation from the baseline model due to exposure to the ship. We illustrate this by addding a dependency on the covariate $E_{ship}$ in the parameters $\tau$ and $\nu$. 
For $i \in \{1, \cdots, 6\}$ and $t \geq t_{exp}^{(i)}$

\begin{equation} \left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
		
		\log(\tau^{(i)}(t))=\log(\tau_{0,post}) +\sum_{k=1}^{q_{\tau}} \log(\tau_{k,post})\phi_{k}(E_{ship}(t))+b^{(i)}_{\tau,post} \\
		\log(\nu^{(i)}(t))=\log(\nu_{0,post}) +  \sum_{k=1}^{q_{\nu}} \log(\nu_{k,post}) \xi_{k}(E_{ship}(t)) +b^{(i)}_{\nu,post}  \\
		\omega^{(i)}(t)=\omega_{0,post}+\sum_{k=1}^{q_E\times q_{\Theta}} \omega_{k,post} \psi_k(D_{shore}(t),\Theta(t)) + b_{\omega,post}^{(i)}
	\end{array}
	\right.
	\label{eq: response model}
\end{equation}

Again, $\log(\tau_{0,post})$, $\log(\nu_{0,post})$, $\omega_{0,post}$ are unknown intercepts and $b^{(i)}_{post} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, \diag\left(\frac{1}{\lambda_{post}}\right)\right)$ with $\lambda_{post}=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\sigma_{\tau,post}^2} & \frac{1}{\sigma_{\nu,post}^2} & \frac{1}{\sigma_{\omega,post}^2} \end{pmatrix}^\top$.
Under the approximation that parameters are piecewise constant, we can write the mixed effect models in matrix form with the same notations as above.
\begin{equation}
	\rho_{post}
	=X_{post} \beta_{post}
	+Z_{post} b_{post}
\end{equation}

Estimation procedure for the vectors of coefficient $\beta_{pre}$, $\beta_{post}$ and the expected values of the random effects $b_{pre}$, $b_{post}$ given the observations will be discussed in section~\ref{section: inference}.\\


\subsection{Inference}
\label{section: inference}

\subsubsection{State space model for the rotational CVM}

As discussed in \cite{ditlevsen_hypoelliptic_2018}, estimation for such hypoelliptic models can be challenging. The main difficulties come from
\begin{itemize}
	 \item irregular times of observations : we only get position when the marine mammal reaches the sea surface.
	 \item GPS measurement errors, with gaussian or student distribution.
	 \item partial observations : two processes are involved in equation~\ref{eq: RACVM equation}, however only one of them can be observed, that is the position.
\end{itemize}


Several method already exist to estimate constant parameters $\tau$, $\nu$ and $\mu$.
If the parameters are constant, it is possible to use a method of moments based on the distributional results about the velocity process \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017}, but it is only feasible when measurement errors are negligible. More efficiently, maximum likelihood with Kalman filter allows to estimate from observations with errors \cite{johnson_continuous_2008}.
If the parameters are allowed to depend on time through external covariates, then \texttt{smoothSDE} package, which is based on \cite{johnson_continuous_2008} but exploit the capabilities of both the \texttt{mgcv} \cite{wood_generalized_2017} and \texttt{TMB} \cite{kristensen_tmb_2016} packages, is a convenient tool for estimation. 
%Discuss the improvement/differences compared to Gurarie and Albertsen, Michelot etc

Consider equation~\ref{eq: RACVM equation} with parameters $\tau$, $\nu$, $\mu$ and $\omega$ depending on time.
If we suppose these parameters to be constant on each time step $[t_j,t_{j+1}]$ it can be solved explicitly. Denote $\Delta_j=t_{j+1}-t_j$, $v_j=v(t_j)$, $x_j=x(t_j)$, $\mu_j=\mu(t_j)$, $\tau_j=\tau(t_j)$, $\nu_j=\nu(t_j)$,$\omega_j=\omega(t_j)$ and $A_j=A(t_j)$. Then applying Itô's formula gives

\begin{equation}
	\forall j \in \{1, \cdots, n\} \quad 
	\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
		v_{j+1}=\mu_j +\exp(-A_j\Delta_j)(v_j-\mu_j)+\zeta_j \\
		x_{j+1}=x_j+\mu_j \Delta_j+A_j^{-1}(I_2-\exp(-A_j\Delta_j))(v_j-\mu_j)+\xi_j
	\end{array}\right. \\
	\label{eq: RCVM autoregressive formula}
\end{equation}


where $\zeta_j$ and $\xi_j$ are centered normal random variables.\\
Denote $\alpha_j=\begin{pmatrix} x_{j,1}  & x_{j,2} & v_{j,1} & v_{j,2}\end{pmatrix}^\top$ the hidden state and $y_j$ the observed GPS position at time $t_j$. Measurement errors are supposed to be gaussian in order to be able to use the basic Kalman filter equations. The state space equations are

\[
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
	y_j=Z\alpha_j+\varepsilon_j \\
	\alpha_{j+1}=T_j \alpha_j+B_j \mu_j + \eta_j
\end{array}
\right.\]
where the link matrices are 
\[Z=\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0_{2,2}\end{pmatrix} \quad  T_j=\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & A_j^{-1}(I_2-\exp(-A_j \Delta_j)) \\ 0_{2,2} & \exp(-A_j \Delta_j) \end{pmatrix} \quad B_j=\begin{pmatrix}
	\Delta_j I_2-A_j^{-1}(I_2-\exp(-A_j\Delta_j)) \\
	I_2-\exp(-A_j\Delta_j)\end{pmatrix}
\]


$\varepsilon_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{obs}^2 I_2)$ and the vector $\eta_j=\begin{pmatrix} \xi_{j,1} & \xi_{j,2} & \zeta_{j,1} & \zeta_{j,2} \end{pmatrix}^\top$ is a 4 dimensional normal random vector, with mean zero. Its covariance matrix $Q_j$ can be computed explicitly.
\begin{equation}
	Q_j=\begin{pmatrix}
		M_j & L_j \\
		L_j & N_j
	\end{pmatrix}
	\label{eq: state space covariance}
\end{equation}
where $M_j$, $N_j$and $L_j$ are block matrices of size $2 \times 2$ such that 
\[M_j=\left( \Delta-2 \frac{\omega_j \sin(\omega_j \Delta_j)-\frac{1}{\tau_j} \cos(\omega_j \Delta_j)}{\frac{1}{\tau_j^2}+\omega_j^2 } \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta_j}{\tau_j} \right) +\frac{\tau_j}{2} \left( \frac{\omega_j^2-\frac{3}{\tau_j^2}}{\frac{1}{\tau_j^2}+\omega_j^2}-\exp\left( -\frac{2\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right)\right) \right)I_2\]

\[N_j=\frac{2\nu_j^2}{\pi}\left(1-e^{-\frac{2 \Delta_j}{\tau_j}}\right)I_2\]

\[L_j=\begin{pmatrix} l_1 & l_2 \\
	l_2 & l_1\end{pmatrix}\]
where 
\[l_1=\frac{4\nu_j^2}{2 \pi \tau_j \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau_j^2}+\omega_j^2\right)} \times \left( 1+\exp\left( -\frac{2\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right)-2\exp\left( -\frac{\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right)-2\exp\left( -\frac{\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right) \cos(\omega_j \Delta_j)\right)\]
\[l_2=\frac{4\nu_j^2}{2 \pi \tau_j \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau_j^2}+\omega_j^2\right)} \times\left( \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right) \sin(\omega_j \Delta_j)-\frac{\omega_j \tau_j}{2} \left(1-\exp\left( -2 \frac{\Delta_j}{\tau_j}\right) \right)\right)\]

One can check that for $\omega_j=0$, the formulas match the ones of the CTCRW model.
We coded these formulas in the \texttt{smoothSDE} package to allow fast maximum likelihood inference of smooth parameters $\tau$,$\nu$ and $\omega$ by making the most of the power of the R package \texttt{TMB}. 


\subsubsection{Maximum likelihood estimation}
The formulation of a state space model now allows for maximum likelihood estimation using Kalman filter.
We detail the maximum likelihood estimation for the response model in section~\ref{subsection: ship exposure effect}. \\

The spline coefficients in equation~\ref{eq: response model} will be treated as random effects to include a penalization in the log-likelihood. 
Introduce smoothing parameters $\lambda_{\tau}$,$\lambda_{\nu}$, $\lambda_{\omega,E}$ and $\lambda_{\omega,\Theta}$. The vectors of spline regression coefficients $\log(\tau_{post})$, $\log(\nu_{post})$, $\omega_{post}$,  conditioned on the smoothing parameter are supposed to follow independent multivariate normal distributions with means zero and respective precision matrices $\lambda_{\tau}S_{\tau}$, $\lambda_{\nu}S_{\nu}$ and $\lambda_{\omega,E}S_{\omega,E}+\lambda_{\omega,\Theta}S_{\omega,\Theta}$. $S_{\tau}$, $S_{\nu}$, $S_{\omega,E}$ and $S_{\omega,\Theta}$ are penalization matrices of known coefficients such that 
$\log(\tau_{post})^\top S_{\tau}\log(\tau_{post})$, $\log(\nu_{post})^\top S_{\nu}\log(\nu_{post})$, and $\omega_{post}^\top (S_{\omega,E}+S_{\omega,\Theta})\omega_{post}$ measure the wiggliness of the fitted splines \cite{michelot_varying-coefficient_2021}. Thus, the chosen prior favours smooth functions over wiggly ones. Now, the mixed effect model equation can be rewritten as $\rho_{post}=X_{post}\beta_{post}+Z_{post} b_{post}$ where the fixed effect coefficients are changed to $\beta_{post}=\begin{pmatrix} \log(\tau_{0,post}) & \log(\nu_{0,post}) & \omega_{0,post} \end{pmatrix} $ and the random effects to 
\[b_{post}=\begin{pmatrix} \log(\tau_{post}) & b_{\tau,post} & \log(\nu_{post}) & b_{2,post} & \omega_{post} & b_{\omega,post}\end{pmatrix}\]
Note that the actual random effects $b_{\tau,post}$, $b_{\nu,post}$,$b_{\omega,post}$ also enter the same framework with a "penalization" matrix which is identity and smoothing parameters that are the inverse of the variances to be estimated.
All these smoothing parameters are gathered in a vector $\log(\lambda_{post})$ that is estimated from the data.
\\


Denote $y^{(i)}$,  $i \in \{1, \cdots, 6\}$, the observed track for the $i$-th narwhal after exposure, which consists in $n_i$ GPS positions.

The complete likelihood of the data and the random effects  is 

\begin{align*}
	L_c(\pmb{b_{post}},\beta_{post},\log(\lambda_{post}),\log(\sigma_{obs}))&= 
	\prod_{i=1}^{6} p\left(\pmb{b^{(i)}_{post}},\log(\tau_{post}),\log(\nu_{post}),\omega_{post} \vert \log(\lambda_{post})\right) \\
	&\times p\left(y^{(i)} \vert \pmb{b^{(i)}_{post}},\log(\tau_{post}),\log(\nu_{post}),\omega_{post},\beta_{post},\log(\lambda_{post}),\log(\sigma_{obs})\right)
	\label{eq: random effects likelihood}
\end{align*}

The terms $p\left(b^{(i)}_{post},  
\log(\tau_{post}),\log(\nu_{post}),\omega_{post}\vert \log(\lambda_{post})\right)$ can be computed since $b^{(i)}_{post}$, $\log(\tau_{post})$ and  $\log(\nu_{post})$ are independent and their distributions are known multivariate gaussians.\\

For each individual $i \in \{1,\cdots,6\}$, the distribution of the hidden state $\alpha^{(i)}_j=\begin{pmatrix} x^{(i)}_{j,1} & x^{(i)}_{j,2} & v^{(i)}_{j,1} & v^{(i)}_{j,2}\end{pmatrix}^\top$ conditioned on previous observations and random effects, i.e $\alpha_j^{(i)} \vert (y^{(i)}_{1:j-1},b_{post}^{(i)},\log(\tau_{post}),\log(\nu_{post}),\omega_{post})$, is $\mathcal{N}(\alpha_j^{(i)-}, R_j^{(i)-})$ where the matrices $\alpha_j^{(i)-}$ and $R_j^{(i)-}$ are computed by the Kalman filter with parameter values according to the conditioned values of the random effects and the equation~\ref{eq: response model}.
Hence
\begin{equation} y_j^{(i)} \vert (y_{1:j-1}^{(i)}, b_{pre}^{(i)}) \sim \mathcal{N} \left( Z \alpha_j^{(i)-},Z R_j^{(i)-} Z^\top+\sigma_{obs}^2 I_2 \right)
	\label{eq: ditribution of observations conditioned on random effects}
\end{equation}
and the density $p\left(y^{(i)} \vert \pmb{b^{(i)}_{post}},\log(\tau_{post}),\log(\nu_{post}),\omega_{post},\beta_{post},\log(\lambda),\log(\sigma_{obs})\right)$ is deduced from this result.


Let $\mathcal{L}_c(\pmb{b_{post}},\beta_{post},\log(\lambda_{post}),\log(\sigma_{obs});y)= - \log( L_c(\pmb{b_{post}},\beta_{post},\log(\lambda_{post}),\log(\sigma_{obs})))$ be the joint negative log-likelihood of the data and the random effects. 
Then the likelihood of the data is the integral 
\[
L(\beta_{post},\log(\lambda_{post}),\log(\sigma_{obs});y)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}} \exp(-\mathcal{L}_c(\pmb{b_{post}},\theta_{pre},\log(\lambda_{pre}),\log(\sigma_{obs});y) )d\pmb{b_{post}}
\]
where in this specific case, $N=18+q_{\tau}+q_{\nu}+q_{E}\times q_{\Theta}$.


The package \texttt{smooothSDE} relies on the package \texttt{TMB} to optimize this likelihood and get estimations of the coefficients.
Laplace's approximation consists in finding a minimum of the function $\mathcal{L}_c$ with respect to $b_{post}$ and then approximating the integral over this parameter by the integral of a gaussian curve.
This approximation is then optimized over $\beta_{post}$, $\log(\lambda_{post})$ and $\log(\sigma_{obs})$ using gradient methods and auto-differentiation \cite{kristensen_tmb_2016}. More precisely, optimization is  performed by using the usual \texttt{optim} R function, and plugging in the gradient function calculated by \texttt{TMB} via automatic differentiation. The BFGS method (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm) is generally used for non linear unconstrained problems. If we set constraints on the SDE parameter (maximum values of $\tau$ and $\nu$) based on biological expertise for instance, then Limited Memory BFGS with box constraints method should be preferred. In this study, BFGS method was used.\\
Results of the optimization are estimated parameters intercepts $\hat{\beta}_{post}$, estimated smooothing parameters $\log(\hat{\lambda}_{post})$, estimated modes $\hat{b}_{post}^{(i)}$ of the random effects, and possibly estimated log of the standard deviation $\log(\hat{\sigma}_{obs})$ for the measurement error.
Uncertainties on the estimates are derived from the inverse of the hessian matrix of the negative log-likelihood at estimated values and the delta method \cite{kristensen_tmb_2016}.

\subsection{Simulation of constrained motion}
In order to test the constrained models we simulated the CRCVM process within different domains for smooth parameters $\omega$ depending on the angle $\Theta$ and the distance to the boundary of the domain $D_{shore}$.
For the process to be constrained, the velocity should rotate whenever the position is close to the boundary of the domain. For the velocity to rotate, it is necessary to have a non zero value of $\omega$. Moreover, the closer we are to the shore, the faster the velocity should rotate. 
Eventually, at a certain distance from the coast, there should be no further effect of the shore, meaning that $\omega$ should be $0$. In this case, the movement model is simply an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, as in the unconstrained case.
First define a weight based on the distance to the shore.
\[c(D_{shore})=\exp\left(-\kappa \times \left(\frac{D_{shore}}{D_0}\right)^2\right)\mbox{ for some } D_0>0 \mbox{ and } \kappa>0\]

Then define how $\omega$ should depend on the angle $\Theta$ and the distance to the shore $D_{shore}$ based on this weight :

\[
\omega(\theta,D_{shore})=\frac{\omega_0}{2}\left(\tanh(\lambda(\theta+\frac{\pi}{2}))+\tanh(\lambda(\theta-\frac{\pi}{2})))\right)\times c(D_{shore})
\]
for some $\omega_0 \in \R$, $\lambda>0$


\textcolor{red}{Add more explanation about why we choose these formulas}

Figure~\ref{fig: trueomega} shows the smooth function obtained for the parameter $\omega$ and  values different values of $D_0$, $\lambda$ and $\kappa$.

$3$ days long trajectories were sampled in a rectangular domain with sides of length $8$ km from the CRCVM with the smooth function for $\omega$ displayed in figure~\ref{fig: trueomega}(a) and other parameters kept constant ($\nu = 4$ km/h, $\tau=1$ h). For each trajectory, initial velocity was set to $0$ and initial position was uniformly sampled in the rectangular domain, at least $500$ metres away from the boundary. Time steps were chosen equal to $1$ min for high frequency and subsampled to $5$ minutes for low frequency. Gaussian measurement errors with low standard deviation $\sigma_{obs}=3$ m and large standard deviations $\sigma_{obs}=30$ m were added to provide the actual observations. Of these $100$ trajectories, none reach the boundary for $\sigma_{obs}=3$ m and only one for $\sigma_{obs}=30$m. However, too small values of $D_0$ and $\omega_0$, as well as too large measurement errors may produce samples that reach the boundary of the domain. Figure~\ref{fig: samples_rect_CRCVM} shows some of the 100 samples obtained in the rectangular domain. \\


10 trajectories were also simulated in Scoresby Sound fjords system in which the narwhals move under constraints. The parameter $\omega$ was defined as the smooth function displayed in~\ref{fig: trueomega}(b). Again, for each trajectory, initial velocity was set to $0$ and initial position was uniformly sampled within the sea, with the requirement that it should be at least $500$ metres away from the shore. Time steps were also kept constant, equal to $1$ min for high frequency and subsampled to $5$ min for low frequency. None of the 10 trajectories reached land. Note that if time steps are too large, the assumption of constant covariates between observations is very likely to be violated due to the steepness of the shoreline, resulting in samples that reach land very often. For the fjords system, this already happens if we try to sample directly with $5$ min time steps. Constrained samples within the geometry of Scoresby sound fjords are shown in~\ref{fig: samples_fjords_CRCVM}. Moreover, sampling within the fjords takes much more time than within the rectangular domain, since it is necessary to loop over each polygon of the geometry to compute the nearest shore point for each new position.

To assess whether the CRCVM can describe a tendecy to move along the boundary, $\tau$ was then also expressed as a smooth function of $D_{shore}$ and $\Theta$.
\begin{align*}	
	\tau(\theta,D_{shore})&=(1-c(D_{shore}))\times \tau_0 +c(D_{shore}) \times   \\

\subsection{Estimation with tensor splines}



The samples from previous section were used to estimate the function $\omega$, both in the rectangular domain and in Scoresby Sound fjords system. Covariates $E_{shore}$ and $\Theta$ were computed from the observed positions and the smooth parameter $\omega$ was estimated using bivariate tensor splines of these covariates, given by the function \texttt{te} in \texttt{R}. The marginal spline degree of freedom was set to $5$ for each covariate. Hence, $25$ coefficients (including the intercept) were to be estimated. The other parameters of the diffusion were supposed to be known, as well as the measurement error. Underestimation of the smooth parameter $\omega$ is observed close to the shore as $\Theta$ approaches $\pm \pi$ (movement toward the shore). This is easily seen in figures \ref{fig: marginal_estimates_rect_CRCVM}(a)-(b) and and \ref{fig: marginal_estimates_fjords_CRCVM}(a)-(b).


As measurement error grows, the covariates that are estimated from the observed positions are becoming less accurate, which makes estimation more challenging. THta is why slight differences in figures ~\ref{fig: marginal_estimates_rect_CRCVM}(a)-(b).

\section{Estimation of ship exposure effect on real narwhal data}

A baseline model is fitted on the narwhals's track before exposure. It is supposed to capture the characteristics of the movement under normal conditions. Deviation from the baseline is then assessed by fitting a model with covariates $E$ on the tracks during exposure.

\subsection{Estimation without constraints}

First, a simple CVM (see equation \ref{eq: CVM equation}) was used to assess any behavioural response of the narwhals to the ship exposure.

\subsubsection{Baseline estimations}
Due to the low variability of the estimates of $\tau$ for each individual, it was chosen to only estimate one intercept value for this parameter. It was estimated to $\hat{\tau}_{pre}=0.90 $ km/h with $95 \%$ of its values comprised between $0.85$ and $1.1$ h.
In comparison, harbour seal in Alaska were proved to exhibit slightly more persistent motion $\hat{\tau}=1.51$ h with $95\%$ CI ; $1.30 -1.75$  \cite{johnson_continuous_2008} while bowhead whales in Greenland showed much less persistence $\hat{\tau}=0.17$ h with $95\%$ CI ; $0.14 -0.20$  \cite{gurarie_correlated_2017}.
The intercept value for $\nu$ was estimated to be $\hat{\nu}_{pre}=4.19$ km/h with $95\%$ CI $3.79-4.63$.
The estimates for the long term velocity $\mu$ show that all the narwhals have a tendency to move toward the south ($\mu_2<0$) with more individual variability for the east-west direction $\mu_1$. However, confidence intervals are large and it might be possible to simply force $\mu$ to $(0,0)$.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
  
    \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/unconstrained_models/baseline/re_baseline2_mu1.png}
    \caption{Estimated $\mu_1$ (km/h) for the baseline model}
    \label{fig: re_baseline1_mu1}
    \end{subfigure}
     \begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/unconstrained_models/baseline/re_baseline2_mu2.png}
    \caption{Estimated $\mu_2$ (km/h) for the baseline model}
    \label{fig: re_baseline1_mu2}
    \end{subfigure}
  	\begin{subfigure}{0.49\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/unconstrained_models/baseline/re_baseline2_nu.png}
	\caption{Estimated $\nu$ (km/h)for the baseline model}
	\label{fig: re_baseline1_tau}
	\end{subfigure}
    \caption{Estimated parameters for each individual in the baseline model : the y axis are the estimated parameters along with $95 \%$ confidence interval and the x-axis represents the narwhals's ID.}
    \label{fig: constraints free baseline estimates}
\end{figure}

The estimated values for $\nu$ are all close to $4$ km/h with slight variations among individuals. This value should not be come as a surprise since the mean value of the horizontal velocity norm in the data is $4.4$ km/h, and it is known  that once the velocity process has reached stationarity (typically after $3\tau$), its norm follows a Rice distribution, whose mean is close to $\nu$ when $\vert\vert\mu\vert \vert$ is 
close to $0$.\\

The response model after exposure will be compared to this baseline model to assess any external effect on the narwhals's movement. Examining deviations from this baseline only makes sense when the model is reliable and describes well the narwhals's movement under normal conditions.
To check the goodness of fit of the baseline model, two statistics are computed from the observed tracks of each narwhal : mean velocity norm and the mean velocity phase. For the $i$-th narwhal, the mean velocity norm and phase are approximated as
\[\tilde{v}^{(i)}=\frac{1}{n_i-1}\sum_{j=1}^{n_i-1}  \tilde{v}^{(i)}_j \quad \tilde{\phi}^{(i)}=\frac{1}{n_i-1} \sum_{j=1}^{n_i-1} \widehat{(v_j^{(i)},e)} \mbox{ where } e=(1,0)\]
where $\tilde{v}^{(i)}_j=\frac{y_{j+1}^{(i)}-y^{(i)}_j}{\Delta^{(i)}_j}$, $n_i$ is the number of measurements, $y^{(i)}_j$ is the GPS position of the narwhal $i$ at time $t_j^{(i)}$ and $\Delta^{(i)}_j=t^{(i)}_{j+1}-t^{(i)}_j$.\\
Then the intercepts and modes of the random effects of the fitted baseline model are sampled 500 times from the posterior distribution using the joint covariance matrix produced by the optimization of the likelihood. Draws of the parameters of the SDE are deduced from the sampled coefficients and one trajectory is simulated for each narwhal according to the sampled parameters. For each simulated trajectory, mean of the norm and the phase of the velocity are estimated. This produces an histogram for each statistic (norm and phase) and each narwhal. If sampled tracks have enough similarities with the observed tracks, then the observed statistics should appear near the middle of the histograms. This checking procedure was introduced in \cite{michelot_continuous-time_2022}. Figures~\ref{fig: baseline velocity norm posterior check} and~\ref{fig: baseline velocity phase posterior check} show respectively the histograms of the mean velocity norm and the mean velocity phase.

 \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/unconstrained_models/baseline/check_mean_vnorm_baseline2.png}
    \caption{Histogram of the mean velocity computed from trajectories of the fitted model for each narwhal, along with observed values in red.}
    \label{fig: baseline velocity norm posterior check}
\end{figure}

 \begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/unconstrained_models/baseline/check_mean_phase_baseline2.png}
    \caption{Histogram of the phase angle of the velocity computed from trajectories of the fitted model for each narwhal, along with observed values in red.}
    \label{fig: baseline velocity phase posterior check}
\end{figure}


The fitted baseline model seems to capture well the mean velocity norm and phase of the observed data for the majority of the narwhals. However, attention should be drawn on the phase angle histogram for the narwhal A6, which reveals a mismatch between the model and the observed phase angle. Narwhal A6 is likely to be heading in the south direction (mean phase angle close to $-\frac{\pi}{2})$. 


\subsubsection{Response estimations}


Once the baseline model is deemed satisfactory, a response model is fitted on the tracks during exposure. We computed the marginal and conditional AIC values with different number of knotrs for the spline estimation of the parameters $\tau$ and $\nu$. The marginal AIC is defined in \cite{wood_generalized_2017} as $- 2L + 2k$ where L is the maximum marginal log-likelihood (of fixed effects), and $k$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the fixed effect component of the model. The conditional AIC also defined in \cite{wood_generalized_2017} is $- 2L' + 2k'$ where $L'$ is the maximum joint log-likelihood (of fixed and random effects), and $k'$ is the number of effective degrees of freedom of the model. Note that  the effective degree of freedom is not properly a number of degrees of freedom, but rather a measure of the flexibility or complexity of the model %detail how AIC is computed (wood); based on the trace of the Hessian matrix of the negative log likelihood.
%Intuition for the effective degreed of freedom
%Tendency to favour more complex model when the true model is not in the set of models tested

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/unconstrained_models/response/plotAIC3.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{fig: plotAIC3}
\end{figure}

After $q=7$, the decrease in the marginal AIC curve seems to be lower than it was before. This suggests to choose $q-1=6$ knots for the estimation of the parameters with cubic spline. Note that choosing $q$ a bit lower or higher does not change dramatically the estimated smooth functions.
Figure~\ref{fig: fe_response3_tau_ExpShip} shows the estimated fixed effects of the covariate $E$ for the parameter $\tau$. Figure~\ref{fig: fe_response3_nu_ExpShip} shows the same plot but for the smooth parameter $\nu$. The variable on the x-axis is the distance to the shore, that is the inverse of $E$.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/unconstrained_models/response/fe_response3_tau_ExpShip.png}
    \caption{Estimation of the fixed effects for $\tau$ with 95\% pointwise confidence interval. The red curve is the estimated function, the dotted line is the intercept estimated in the baseline with its 95\% confidence interval in light grey.}
    \label{fig: fe_response3_tau_ExpShip}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/unconstrained_models/response/fe_response3_nu_ExpShip.png}
	\caption{Estimation of the fixed effects for $\nu$ with 95\% pointwise confidence interval. The red curve is the estimated function, the dotted line is the intercept estimated in the baseline with its 95\% confidence interval in light grey.}
	\label{fig: fe_response3_nu_ExpShip}
\end{figure}

Deviations from undisturbed behaviour coincide with intervals on the x-axis where the confidence intervals of the baseline estimate and the response estimate are disjoint. 
This happens for the parameter $\nu$ when the narwhals are highly exposed to the ship, more precisely when they are at a distance to the ship lower than $8$ km. In this case, $\nu$ is significantly higher than the baseline value, proving that narwhals tend to move faster when highly exposed to the ship noise. Again, this should not come as a surprise since, for instance, the mean experimental velocity norm when the narwhals are less than $5$ km away from the ship is $5.7$ km/h, which is more than $1$ km/h higher than the mean experimental velocity norm before exposure. 
This also shows that the random component in the velocity equation has more importance when the narwhals are highly exposed to the ship, and can be interpreted as more variability in the narwhals horizontal velocity.
Regarding the persistence parameter, it is significantly lower than average in two cases. First, when the narwhals are very close to the ship (distance $<3.5$ km), it can be up to third times less persistent than usual. Then, up to $25$ km away from the ship, no significant deviation from the baseline value can be ascertained. However, more than $25$ km away from the ship, it can still be detected that the narwhals persistence is a bit lower than the baseline value (around $0.6$ instead of $0.9$). This decrease in persistence reveals that the animals gets generally agitated and have a tendency to change their heading more frequently when the military ship is sailing in the fjords.\\

Narwhals position relative to the ship were considered :
\begin{itemize}
	\item very close when the distance to the ship was lower than the $5\%$. quantile, which is $4.04$ km.
	\item close when the distance to the ship was lower than the $25\%$ quantile, which is $9.35$ km.
	\item medium when the distance to the ship was between the $25\%$ and $75\%$ quantile, that is between $9.35$ and $25.80$ km.
	\item far otherwise.

The effect of the shore was included directly in the baseline model through bivariate splines of the Distance to the shore and the angle $\Theta$.
The mean velocity $\mu$ was fixed to $(0,0)$ and $\omega$ was estimated as smooth functions of $D_{shore}$ and $\Theta$.

\section{Detailed computations of the integrated rotational Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model}
\label{section: detailed RACVM computations}

\subsection{Velocity process}

\subsubsection{Solution to the SDE}

To solve this equation, the method is similar to the 1-dimensional case.

Consider $X(t)=\exp(At)v(t)$ where $\exp(At)=\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty} \frac{A^n t^n}{n!}$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix.\\
Thus $X(t)=g(t,v_t)$ where 
\[\begin{array}{ccccc}
	g & : & \mathbb{R}^+ \times \mathbb{R}^2 & \longrightarrow & \mathbb{R} \\
	& & (t,x_1,x_2) & \longmapsto & e^{A t}
	\begin{pmatrix} 
		x_1 \\
		x_2 \end{pmatrix}
\end{array}\]


The multidimensional Itô formula (theorem 4.2.1 in \cite{oksendal}) gives
\[dX(t)=A\exp(At) v(t) dt +\exp(At) dv(t)\]
Replacing $dv(t)$ by its expression 
\begin{align*}
	dX(t)&=A\exp(At) v(t) dt +\exp(At)\left(-A(v(t)-\mu)dt+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} dW(t) \right)\\
	&=A\exp(At) \mu dt+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \exp(At)dW(t)
\end{align*}
Integrate from $0$ to $t$
\[\exp(At)v(t)-v(0)=(\exp(At)-I_2) \mu +\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_{0}^{t} \exp(As) dW(s)\]
Hence
\begin{equation}
	v(t)=\exp(-At) v(0)+ (I_2-\exp(-At))\mu +\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}}\int_{0}^{t} \exp(A(s-t)) dW(s)
	\label{eq: RACVM solution}
\end{equation}
In the sequel, we shall use the notation 
\[\zeta(0,t) =\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}}\int_{0}^{t} \exp(A(s-t)) dW(s)\] 

Replacing $\exp(At)$ by its expression gives more explicitly
\begin{equation}
	v_1(t)=e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \left(\cos(\omega t)v_1(0)+\sin(\omega t)v_2(0)\right)+(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\cos(\omega t))\mu_1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega t) \mu_2 +\zeta_1(0,t)
	\label{eq: first random component RACVM}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
	v_2(t)=e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \left(-\sin(\omega t)v_1(0)+\cos(\omega t)v_2(0)\right)+e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega t) \mu_1+(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}\cos(\omega t))\mu_2 +\zeta_2(0,t)
	\label{eq: second random component RACVM}
\end{equation}
where \begin{align*}
	\zeta_1(0,t)&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-t)) dW_1(s) -\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-t)) dW_2(s) \\
	\zeta_2(0,t)&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-t)) dW_1(s) +\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-t)) dW_2(s)
\end{align*}
\subsubsection{Autoregressive equation}

For $t \geq 0$ and $\Delta >0$, 
\begin{align*}
	v(t+\Delta)&=\exp(-A(t+\Delta))v(0)+(I_2-\exp(-A(t+\Delta))) \mu +\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(s-(t+\Delta)))dW(s) \\
	&= \exp(-A\Delta) \bigg( \exp(-At) v(0) +(\exp(A\Delta)-\exp(At))\mu \\
	&+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t \exp(A(s-t)) dW(s) + \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(s-t))dW(s) \bigg)
\end{align*}
However 
\[\exp(-At)v(0)++\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t \exp(A(s-t)) dW(s)=v(t)-(I_2-\exp(-At))\mu\]
Hence

\begin{align*}
	v(t+\Delta)=\exp(-A\Delta) \bigg( (\exp(A\Delta)-\exp(-At)) \mu +v(t)-(I_2-\exp(-At))\mu + \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(s-t))dW(s) \bigg)
\end{align*}

In the end,

\[v(t+\Delta)=\mu +\exp(-A\Delta)(v(t)-\mu) + \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(s-(t+\Delta))) dW(s) \]

Let $\zeta(t,t+\Delta)=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(s-(t+\Delta))) dW(s)$. It is a multivariate gaussian with mean zero.

The variances are given by Itô's isometry.

\begin{align*}
	Var(\zeta_1(t,t+\Delta))&= \frac{4\nu^2}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp \left( 2 \frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau} \right) \cos^2(\omega (s-(t+\Delta))) ds \\ + &\frac{4\nu^2}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp \left( 2 \frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau} \right) \sin^2(\omega (s-(t+\Delta))) ds \\
	&= \frac{4\nu^2}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp \left( 2 \frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau} \right) ds \\
	&= \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}(1-e^{-\frac{2 \Delta}{\tau}})
\end{align*}

Similarly, 
\[Var(\zeta_2(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}(1-e^{-\frac{2 \Delta}{\tau}})\]

And the terms in $Cov(\zeta_1(t,t+\Delta),\zeta_2(t,t+\Delta))$ cancel so that 
\[
Cov(\zeta_1(t,t+\Delta),\zeta_2(t,t+\Delta))=0
\]

Consequently, 
\[v(t+\Delta) \vert v(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \mu + \exp(-A\Delta)(v(t)-\mu), \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}(1-e^{-2\frac{\Delta}{\tau}}) I_2 \right) \]

Intuitively, the next velocity has a mean that is the sum of the long term mean velocity $\mu$ and the deviation of the previous velocity from this long term mean rotated by an angle $\omega \Delta$.
\subsubsection{Stationary distribution}

We have seen that 
\[v(t)=\exp(-At) v(0)+(I_2-\exp(-At))\mu + \zeta(0,t)\]
where $\zeta(0,t) \sim \mathcal{N} \left(0, \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} (1-e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau}}) I_2 \right) $ so that 
\[v(t) \underset{t \rightarrow +\infty}{\overset{\mathcal{D}}{\longrightarrow}}\mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} I_2 \right) \]

If $v(0) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} I_2\right)$ then for all $t \geq 0$, $v(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu,\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} I_2\right)$

\subsubsection{Distribution of the velocity norm and phase}

suppose that $t\geq \frac{3}{\beta}$ so that the velocity has reached its stationary distribution
\begin{align*}
	&v_1(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_1, \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}\right) \\
	&v_2(t) \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_2, \frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}\right)
\end{align*}

\end{figure}
Thus, $ \vert \vert v(t) \vert \vert$ follows a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_distribution}{Rice distribution} with mean parameter $\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert$ and variance parameter $\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi}$. Its probability density function is thus defined by
\[\forall x \geq 0, \quad f(x)= \frac{\pi}{2\nu^2}x \exp\left(-\frac{\pi (x^2+ \vert \vert \mu \vert \vert^2)}{4\nu^2}\right) I_{0}\left(   \frac{\pi}{2\nu^2}\times \vert \vert \mu \vert \vert x \right)\]
where $I_0$ is a modified Besssel function of the first kind defined such that 
\[\forall y  \in \R, \quad I_0(y)=\sum_{m=0}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{m!^2}\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^{2m}\]
Its moments can be expressed with
\[\E\left(\vert \vert v(t) \vert \vert\right)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\nu \times \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{2}} L_{\frac{1}{2}} \left( -\frac{\beta}{\sigma^2} \vert \vert \mu \vert \vert ^2 \right)\]

Here, $L_{\frac{1}{2}}(x)=e^{\frac{x}{2}} \left( (1-x) I_0\left( -\frac{x}{2}\right)-xI_1\left( -\frac{x}{2}\right)\right)$ with $I_1(y)=\sum_{m=0}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{m!(m+1)!}\left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^{2m+1}$.\\

In the case $\mu=(0,0)$, the mean velocity norm is simply 
\[\E(\vert \vert v(t) \vert \vert)=\nu L_{\frac{1}{2}}(0)=\nu I_{0}(0)=\nu\]


Then, in the plane, $v(t)$ can be thought of as a complex random variable $v(t)=v_1(t)+iv_2(t)$ that has complex normal distribution with mean $\mu_1+i\mu_2$, variance $\E\left((v(t)-\E(v(t)))\overline{(v(t)-\E(v(t)))}\right)=\frac{4\nu^
	2}{\pi}$ and pseudo-variance $\E\left((v(t)-\E(v(t)))^2\right)=0$. Thus, $v(t)$ has a circular symmetric normal distribution with mean $\mu_1+i\mu_2=\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert e^{i\theta}$ where $\theta=\arctan(\mu_2,\mu_1) \in [-\pi, \pi]$ and variance $\frac{\sigma^2}{\beta}$.
Denote $\Phi=\arctan(v_2(t),v_1(t)) \in [-\pi, \pi]$ the phase angle of $v(t)$.
According to \cite{letzepis_vonmises_2015,bennett_solving_1956}, the distribution of $\Phi$ is 
\[\forall \phi \in [-\pi,\pi], \quad f_{\Phi}(\phi)=\frac{e^{-\frac{\beta \vert \vert \mu \vert \vert^2}{2\sigma^2}}}{2\pi} +\frac{\sqrt{\beta} \vert \vert \mu \vert \vert}{2\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \cos(\phi-\theta)e^{-\frac{\beta\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert^2 \sin^2(\phi-\theta)}{2\sigma^2}} \times \left(1+\erf\left(\frac{\beta^{\frac{1}{4}}\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert \cos(\phi-\theta)}{\sqrt{2\sigma}}\right)\right)\]
where $\erf$ is the Gauss error function defined by 
\[\forall z \in \R, \quad \erf(z)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}} \int_0^z e^{-t^2} dt\]
When $\mu=0$, this simplifies to a uniform distribution over $[-\pi,\pi]$.\\

\subsubsection{Velocity autocovariance function}

In this section we suppose that $v(0)$ has the stationary distribution.The autocovariance function is the expected dot product of the velocity vectors over different lags.

\[\mathbb{E}(\langle v(t), v(t+\Delta) \rangle =Cov(v_1(t)v_1(t+\Delta))+Cov(v_2(t),v_2(t+\Delta))+\mathbb{E}(v_1(t)) \mathbb{E}(v_1(t+\Delta))+\mathbb{E}(v_2(t)) \mathbb{E}(v_2(t+\Delta))\]

However,
\begin{align*}
	Cov(v_1(t)v_1(t+\Delta))&=e^{-\frac{2t+\Delta}{\tau}} (\cos(\omega t)\cos(\omega (t+\Delta))  Var(v_1(0))+\sin(\omega t)\sin(\omega (t+\Delta))  Var(v_2(0)))\\
	&+Cov(\zeta_1(0,t),\zeta_1(0,t+\Delta)) \\
	&= 2\frac{\nu^2}{\tau} \cos(\omega \Delta)  e^{-\frac{2t+\Delta}{\tau}} +Cov(\zeta_1(0,t),\zeta_1(0,t+\Delta))
\end{align*}

Then compute
\begin{align*}
	&Cov(\zeta_1(0,t),\zeta_1(0,t+\Delta))=\\
	&Cov \bigg( \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-t)) dW_1(s) -\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-t)) dW_2(s), \\
	& \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^{t+\Delta} e^{\frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-(t+\Delta))) dW_1(s) -\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_0^{t+\Delta} e^{\frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-(t+\Delta))) dW_2(s)\bigg) \\
	&=
	\frac{4 \nu^2}{\pi \tau} Cov \left( \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-t)) dW_1(s), \int_0^{t+\Delta} e^{\frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-(t\Delta))) dW_1(s) \right) \\
	&+ \frac{4 \nu^2}{\pi \tau} Cov \left( \int_0^t e^{\frac{s-t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-t)) dW_2(s), \int_0^{t+\Delta} e^{\frac{s-(t+\Delta)}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-(t\Delta))) dW_2(s) \right) \\
	&= \frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau} \int_0^t e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} e^{2 \frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega(s-t)) \cos(\omega(s-(t+\Delta))) ds \\
	& + \frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau} \int_0^t e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} e^{2 \frac{s-t}{\tau}} \sin(\omega(s-t)) \sin(\omega(s-(t+\Delta))) ds \\
	&= \frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau} \int_0^t e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}} e^{2 \frac{s-t}{\tau}} \cos(\omega \Delta) ds
\end{align*}
Therefore we get
\[
Cov(\zeta_1(0,t),\zeta_1(0,t+\Delta))=\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} \cos(\omega \Delta) e^{-\frac{\Delta}{\tau}} (1-e^{-2\frac{t}{\tau}})
\]
And eventually, 
\[ Cov(v_1(t)v_1(t+\Delta))=\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} \cos(\omega \Delta) e^{-\frac{\Delta}{\tau}}\]
Similarly one gets
\[ Cov(v_2(t)v_2(t+\Delta))=\frac{2\nu^2}{\pi} \cos(\omega \Delta) e^{-\frac{\Delta}{\tau}}\]

Therefore, the velocity autocovariance function is 

\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{E}(\langle v(t), v(t+\Delta) \rangle )=\frac{4\nu^2}{\pi} \cos(\omega \Delta) e^{-\frac{\Delta}{\tau}}+\vert \vert \mu \vert \vert^2
	\label{eq: RACVM autocovariance function}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Location process} \label{RACVM location process}
For $t \geq 0$ and $\Delta >0$,

\begin{align*}
	x(t+\Delta)&=x(t)+\int_t^{t+\Delta} v(s) ds \mbox{ where } v(s)=\mu+\exp(-A(s-t))(v(t)-\mu)+\zeta(t,s) \\
	&= x(t)+\mu \Delta+\int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp(-A(s-t))(v(t)-\mu) ds +\int_t^{t+\Delta} \zeta(t,s) ds \\
	&= x(t)+\mu \Delta +\int_0^{\Delta} \exp(-As)(v(t)-\mu) ds +\int_t^{t+\Delta} \zeta(t,s) ds \\
	&=x(t)+\mu \Delta + (A^{-1}(v(t)-\mu)-A^{-1}\exp(-A\Delta)(v(t)-\mu))+\int_t^{t+\Delta} \zeta(t,s) ds \\
\end{align*}
Thus, 
\begin{equation}
	x(t+\Delta)=x(t)+\mu \Delta+A^{-1} \left( I_2-\exp(-A\Delta)\right)(v(t)-\mu) +\xi(t,t+\Delta) \\
	\mbox{ where } \xi(t,t+\Delta)=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \zeta(t,s)ds
\end{equation}
Note that when $\Delta \rightarrow 0$, the deterministic part tends to $x(t)+\Delta v(t)$ as one would expect frome the Euler Maruyama scheme.
It is known that $\xi$ is normally distributed with mean zero. We still have to compute its covariance matrix.

\begin{align*}
	\int_t^{t+\Delta} \zeta(t,s) ds &=\int_t^{t+÷\Delta} \frac{2 \nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \left( \int_t^s \exp(-A((u-s))dW(u) \right) ds \\
	&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi\tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \int_u^{t+\Delta} \exp(A(u-s)) ds \right) dW(u)  \\
	&= \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} (A^{-1}-A^{-1}\exp(A(u-t-\Delta))) dW(u) \\
	&= \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} A^{-1}(I_2-\exp(A(u-t-\Delta))) dW(u)
\end{align*}
From this formula we deduce an expression for both components $\xi_1(t,t+\Delta)$ and $\xi_2(t,t+\Delta)$ of the gaussian vector.
\begin{align*}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\xi_1(t,t+\Delta) \\ \xi_2(t,t+\Delta) 
	\end{pmatrix}
	&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau}} \int_t^{t+\Delta} \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2} 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{1}{\tau} & \omega \\ -\omega & \frac{1}{\tau}
	\end{pmatrix} \times \\
	& \left[ \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta -u}{\tau}\right) 
	\begin{pmatrix} \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) & \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \\
		-\sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) & \cos(\omega(t+\delta-u)) 
	\end{pmatrix} \right]
	\begin{pmatrix}
		dW_1(u) \\ dW_2(u)
	\end{pmatrix}\\
	&= \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \int_t ^{t+\Delta} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\tau} & \omega \\ -\omega & \frac{1}{\tau} \end{pmatrix} \times \\
	&\begin{pmatrix}  1-\exp\left(-\frac{(
			t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) & -\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}]\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \\
		\exp \left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) & 1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\end{pmatrix}
	\times \begin{pmatrix} 
		dW_1(u) \\ dW_2(u)
	\end{pmatrix} \\
	&= \frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \int_t ^{t+\Delta} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\tau} & \omega \\ -\omega & \frac{1}{\tau} \end{pmatrix} \times \\
	& \begin{pmatrix} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right)\cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right) dW_1(u)-\exp\left(  -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))dW_2(u) \\
		\exp\left(  -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))dW_1(u)+\left(1- \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right)\cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)dW_2(u)
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}

Eventually, 
\begin{align*}
	\xi_1(t,t+\Delta)&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \times \frac{1}{\tau} \times \Bigg( \textcolor{red}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( 1-\exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right)\cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)dW_1(u)}\\
	&-\textcolor{blue}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))dW_2(u)}\Bigg) \\
	&+\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)}  \times \omega \Bigg( \textcolor{red}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))dW_1(u)}+ \\
	& \textcolor{blue}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( 1-\exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right)\cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)dW_2(u)}\Bigg)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
	\xi_1(t,t+\Delta)&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)}  \times  \Bigg( \textcolor{red}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \bigg( \frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)}  \\

	&\textcolor{blue}{-\frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \bigg) dW_2(u)} \Bigg)
\end{align*}

Similarly, 
\begin{align*}
	\xi_2(t,t+\Delta)&=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)}  \times \Bigg( \textcolor{red}{\int_t^{t+\Delta} \bigg( \frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))} \\
	&\textcolor{red}{-\omega \left( 1-\exp \left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right) \bigg)dW_1(u)} \\
	&  \textcolor{blue}{+\int_t^{t+\Delta} \bigg( \omega \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta_u))} \\
	&\textcolor{blue}{+\frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \right) \bigg) dW_2(u)} \Bigg)
\end{align*}

Denote 
\begin{align*}
	& \textcolor{red}{X_1=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right) +\omega \exp \left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)dW_1(u)} \\ 
	&\textcolor{red}{Y_1=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) -\omega \left( 1-\exp \left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right) \right)dW_1(u)} \\
	&\textcolor{blue}{X_2=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \omega \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)-\frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \right) dW_2(u)} \\
	&\textcolor{blue}{Y_2=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \omega \exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))+\frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left(-\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau} \right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u)) \right) \right) dW_2(u)} 
\end{align*}
so that both $X_1$,$Y_1$ and $X_2$
,$Y_2$ are independent and 
\[\xi_1(t,t+\Delta)=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)}  \times (X_1+Y_1) \quad \xi_2(t,t+\Delta)=\frac{2\nu}{\sqrt{\pi \tau} \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)}  \times (X_2+Y_2)\]
\[Var(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)^2} (Var(X_1)+Var(Y_1)) \quad Var(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)^2} (Var(X_2)+Var(Y_2)) \]

Itô's isometry yields
\begin{align*}
	Var(X_1)&=\int_t^{t+\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right) +\omega \exp \left( -\frac{t+\Delta-u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega(t+\Delta-u))\right)^2du \\
	&= \int_0^{\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega u)\right) +\omega \exp \left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega u)\right)^2du 
\end{align*}
Similarly, 
\[
Var(Y_1)=\int_0^{\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega u) -\omega \left( 1-\exp \left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega u)\right) \right)^2 du
\]
Hence,
\begin{align*}
	Var(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta))&=\frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)^2} \Bigg( \int_0^{\Delta} \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \left(1-\exp\left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega u)\right) +\omega \exp \left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega u)\right)^2+ \\
	& \left( \frac{1}{\tau} \exp\left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega u) -\omega \left( 1-\exp \left( -\frac{u}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega u)\right) \right)^2 du\Bigg)
\end{align*}

It is possible to see that the formula is exactly the same for $\xi_2(t,t+\Delta)$.

The time integral can be calculated explicitly to obtain
\begin{align*}
	Var(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta))&=Var(\xi_2(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{4\nu^2}{\pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \times \\
	& \left( \Delta-2 \frac{\omega \sin(\omega \Delta)-\frac{1}{\tau} \cos(\omega \Delta)}{\frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2 } \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta}{\tau} \right) +\frac{\tau}{2} \left( \frac{\omega^2-\frac{3}{\tau^2}}{\frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2}-\exp\left( -\frac{2\Delta}{\tau}\right)\right) \right)
\end{align*}
It is easy to check that when $\omega=0$, the formula match the one for the basic correlated velocity model the hidden state. \\
With similar calculations, it can be shown that
\[Cov(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta), \xi_2(t,t+\Delta)=0\]

\subsection{State space model, simulation and parameter estimation}
WIth the same notation as before, for $j \in \{1,\cdots,,n\}$, denote $\alpha_j=\begin{pmatrix} x_{1j} & x_{2j} & v_{1j}-\mu_1 & v_{2j}-\mu_2 \end{pmatrix}^\top$.
To formulate a state space model, we shall need the covariances between the velocity and the locations.
Calculations similar to  section \ref{RACVM location process} give for all $t \geq 0$, $\Delta >0$
\begin{align*}
	Cov(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta),\zeta_1(t,t+\Delta))&=Cov(\xi_2(t,t+\Delta)\zeta_2(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{4\nu^2}{2 \pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \times \\
	& \left( 1+\exp\left( -\frac{2\Delta}{\tau}\right)-2\exp\left( -\frac{\Delta}{\tau}\right)-2\exp\left( -\frac{\Delta}{\tau}\right) \cos(\omega \Delta)\right)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
	Cov(\xi_1(t,t+\Delta),\zeta_2(t,t+\Delta))&=Cov(\xi_2(t,t+\Delta),\zeta_1(t,t+\Delta))=\frac{4\nu^2}{2 \pi \tau \times \left( \frac{1}{\tau^2}+\omega^2\right)} \times \\
	&\left( \exp\left( -\frac{\Delta}{\tau}\right) \sin(\omega \Delta)-\frac{\omega \tau}{2} \left(1-\exp\left( -2 \frac{\Delta}{\tau}\right) \right)\right)
\end{align*}



Therefore, the recursive equations for the state space are
\begin{align*}
	\forall j \in \{1, \cdots, n\}&, \quad 
	\left\{ \begin{array}{l}
		y_j=x_j+\varepsilon_j \\
		v_{j+1}=\mu +\exp(-A\Delta_j)(v_j-\mu)+\zeta_j \\
		x_{j+1}=x_j+\mu \Delta_j+A^{-1}(I_2-\exp(-A\Delta_j))(v_j-\mu)+\xi_j
	\end{array}\right. \\
	&\Leftrightarrow \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
		y_j=Z\alpha_j+\varepsilon_j \\
		\alpha_{j+1}=T_j \alpha_j+B_j \mu + \eta_j
	\end{array}\right.
\end{align*}
where $Z=\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0_2 \end{pmatrix}$, $T_j=\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & A^{-1}(I_2-\exp(-A\Delta_j)) \\
	0_2 & \exp(-A\Delta_j) \end{pmatrix}$, $B_j=\begin{pmatrix}
	\Delta_j I_2 \\
	0_2 \end{pmatrix}$ and $\eta_j=\begin{pmatrix} \xi_j \\ \zeta_j\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} \xi(t_j,t_j+\Delta_j) \\ \zeta(t_j,t_{j+\Delta_j})\end{pmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,Q_j)$ with 
\[Q_j=\begin{pmatrix} 
	Var(\xi_{1,j} & 0 & Cov(\xi_{1,j},\zeta_{1,j}) & Cov(\xi_{1,j},\zeta_{2,j})) \\
	\cdots & Var(\xi_{2,j}) & Cov(\xi_{2,j}, \zeta_{1,j}) & Cov(\xi_{2,j},\zeta_{2,j}) \\
	\cdots & \cdots & Var(\zeta_{1,j}) & 0 \\
	\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & Var(\zeta_{2,j}) 
\end{pmatrix}\] 



\subsection{Kalman filter equations and likelihood}

Now, the conditional law of $\alpha_i$ knowing $y_{1:i}$ is $\mathcal{N}(\hat{\alpha}_i,R_i)$ and the conditional law of $\alpha_i$ knowing $y_{1:i-1}$ is $\mathcal{N}(\hat{\alpha}_i^-,R_i^-)$ where the expectation and covariance matrices are computed as follows.

\paragraph{Kalman filter equations}
\subparagraph{initialization:}
\[\hat{\alpha}_0=\mathbb{E}(\alpha_0)=\begin{pmatrix} \mathbb{E}(x_{1,0}) \\ \mathbb{E}(x_{2,0})  \\ \mathbb{E}(v_{1,0})-\mu_1 \\ \mathbb{E}(v_{2,0})-\mu_2\end{pmatrix} \quad R_0=\begin{pmatrix} Var(x_{1,0}) & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & Var(x_{2,0})  & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & Var(v_{1,0}) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & Var(v_{2,0}) \end{pmatrix}\]
\subparagraph{prediction:}
For $j \in \{2,\cdots,N\}$,
\[\hat{\alpha}_j^-=\tilde{T}_{j-1} \hat{\alpha}_{j-1}+ \tilde{B}_{j-1} \mu\]
\[ R_j^{-} = \tilde{T}_{j-1} R_{j-1} \tilde{T}_{j-1}^\top + \tilde{Q}_{j-1}\]
\subparagraph{correction:}
\[K_j=R_j^- \tilde{Z}^\top \left( \tilde{Z} R_j^- \tilde{Z}^\top +H_j\right)^{-1} \]
\[\hat{\alpha}_j=\hat{\alpha_j}^{-}+K_j \left( y_j-\tilde{Z} \hat{\alpha}_j^-\right)\]
\[R_j=\left(I_4-K_j \tilde{Z} \right) R_j^-\]
where $I_4$ is the $4 \times 4$ identity matrix. \\

From these equations we can deduce the likelihood of an observation $y^*=\begin{pmatrix} y_1^* &\cdots& y_n^* \end{pmatrix}$.\\
Since $y_j=\tilde{Z}\alpha_j+\varepsilon_j$,  $\alpha_j \vert y_{1:j-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{\alpha}_j^-,R_j^-)$, and $\varepsilon_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0,H_j)$ is independent from the observations, we have
\[y_j \vert y_{1:j-1} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\tilde{Z} \hat{\alpha}_i^-,\tilde{Z} R_i^- \tilde{Z}^\top+H_i \right)\]



Thus, if one writes $m_i=\tilde{Z} \hat{\alpha}_i^-$ and $\Gamma_i=\tilde{Z} R_i^- \tilde{Z}^\top +H_i$ then 
\[\mathcal{L}(\sigma, \beta, \mu \vert y^*) =\mathbb{P}(y_0=y_0^*) \prod_{i=2}^n \mathbb{P}(y_i=y_i^* \vert y_{1:i-1}=y_{1:i-1}^*)\]
If we suppose that the initial observation is fixed (not random), then
\[\mathcal{L}(\sigma, \beta, \mu \vert y^*) = \prod_{i=2}^n \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^2 \vert \det(\mu_i) \vert}} \exp \left( -\frac{1}{2} (y_i^*-m_i)^\top \Gamma_i^{-1} (y_i^*-m_i) \right) \]
Hence, the log-likelihood is 
\begin{align*}
    \log \left(\mathcal{L}(\sigma,\beta,\mu \vert y^*)\right)&=\sum_{i=2}^n -\log(\sqrt{(2\pi)^2 \vert \det(\Gamma_i) \vert}) -\frac{1}{2} (y^*_i-m_i)^\top \Gamma_i^{-1} (y^*_i-m_i)\\
    &=\sum_{i=2}^n -\frac{1}{2}\log\left((2\pi)^2 \vert \det(\Gamma_i) \vert\right) -\frac{1}{2} (y^*_i-m_i)^\top \Gamma_i^{-1} (y^*_i-m_i) \\
    &=-(n-1)\log(2\pi)-\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=2}^n \log(\vert \det(\Gamma_i) \vert) +(y^*_i-m_i)^\top \Gamma_i^{-1} (y^*_i-m_i)
\end{align*}
Consequently, the negative log-likelihood that we need to minimize to obtain parameter estimates is 
\[
-\log \left(\mathcal{L}(\sigma,\beta,\mu \vert y^*)\right)=(n-1)\log(2\pi)+\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=2}^n \log(\vert \det(\mu_i) \vert) +(y^*_i-m_i)^\top \mu_i^{-1} (y^*_i-m_i)
\]

The estimated parameters are 
\[\hat{\theta}=(\hat{\sigma},\hat{\beta},\hat{\mu})=\underset{\sigma,\beta,\mu}{\mathrm{argmin}} \left( \sum_{i=2}^n \log(\vert \det(\Gamma_i) \vert) +(y^*_i-m_i)^\top \Gamma_i^{-1} (y^*_i-m_i) \right) \]

\section{Precisions about the statistical models}

In the baseline mixed effect model, the explicit model matrices are 

\[X_{pre}= \begin{bNiceArray}{ccc|ccc}[margin]
	1 & 0 & 0 & \Block{3-3}<\Large>{0} & &  \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & &  \\
	1 & 0 & 0 & & & \\
	\hline
	0 & 1 & 0 &  \Block{3-3}<\Large>{0} & & \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & &  \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & & & \\
	\hline
	0 & 0 & 1 &  \Block{3-3}<\Large>{M_{pre}} & & \\
	\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & &  \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & & & \\
\end{bNiceArray} \quad 
Z_{pre} = \begin{pmatrix}
	J_{1,n_1} \\
	\vdots \\
	J_{6,n_6} \\
	\vdots \\
	J_{13,n_1} \\
	\vdots \\
	J_{18,n_6}
\end{pmatrix} 
\]
where $M_{pre}$ is the matrix with elements  $\psi_k(E^{(i)}_{shore}(t^{(i)}_j))$ on column $k$ and row associated to observation $j$ for narwhal $i$, and $J_{l,m}$ is the matrix with $m$ rows and $18$ columns that has zero everywhere except on column $l$, where there are only ones.

\section{More simulation study}

One track for each of the $6$ narwhals is simulated with known spline fixed effects of the exposure and known random effects. The fixed effects coefficients are estimated from the samples. Figure~\ref{fig: check_fe_response4_sample} shows a sample of the model described in section $3.2$ with known coefficients. This sample is then used to estimate the exposure effects on $\tau$ and $\nu$. True and estimated smooth functions are displayed in figures~\ref{fig: check_fe_response4_sample} and~\ref{fig: check_fe_response4_nu_Xtilde}.
