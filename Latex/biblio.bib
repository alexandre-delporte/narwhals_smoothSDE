	abstract = {One of the last pristine marine soundscapes, the Arctic, is exposed to increasing anthropogenic activities due to climate-induced decrease in sea ice coverage. In this study, we combined movement and behavioral data from animal-borne tags in a controlled sound exposure study to describe the reactions of narwhals, Monodon monoceros, to airgun pulses and ship noise. Sixteen narwhals were live captured and instrumented with satellite tags and Acousonde acoustic-behavioral recorders, and 11 of them were exposed to airgun pulses and vessel sounds. The sound exposure levels ({SELs}) of pulses from a small airgun (3.4 L) used in 2017 and a larger one (17.0 L) used in 2018 were measured using drifting recorders. The experiment was divided into trials with airgun and ship-noise exposure, intertrials with only ship-noise, and pre- and postexposure periods. Both trials and intertrials lasted ∼4 h on average per individual. Depending on the location of the whales, the number of separate exposures ranged between one and eight trials or intertrials. Received pulse {SELs} dropped below 130 {dB} re 1 µPa2 s by 2.5 km for the small airgun and 4–9 km for the larger airgun, and background noise levels were reached at distances of ∼3 and 8–10.5 km, respectively, for the small and big airguns. Avoidance reactions of the whales could be detected at distances {\textgreater}5 km in 2017 and {\textgreater}11 km in 2018 when in line of sight of the seismic vessel. Meanwhile, a ∼30\% increase in horizontal travel speed could be detected up to 2 h before the seismic vessel was in line of sight. Applying line of sight as the criterion for exposure thus excludes some potential pre-response effects, and our estimates of effects must therefore be considered conservative. The whales reacted by changing their swimming speed and direction at distances between 5 and 24 km depending on topographical surroundings where the exposure occurred. The propensity of the whales to move towards the shore increased with increasing exposure (i.e., shorter distance to vessels) and was highest with the large airgun used in 2018, where the whales moved towards the shore at distances of 10–15 km. No long-term effects of the response study could be detected.},

	abstract = {Underwater noise is an important issue globally. Underwater noise can cause auditory masking, behavioural disturbance, hearing damage, and even death for marine animals. While underwater noise levels have been increasing in nonpolar regions, noise levels are thought to be much lower in the Arctic where the presence of sea ice limits anthropogenic activities. However, climate change is causing sea ice to decrease, which is allowing for increased access for noisy anthropogenic activities. Underwater noise may have more severe impacts in the Arctic compared with nonpolar regions due to a combination of lower ambient sound levels and increased sensitivity of Arctic marine animals to underwater noise. Here, we review ambient sound levels in the Arctic, as well as the reactions of Arctic and sub-Arctic marine mammals to underwater noise. We then relate what is known about underwater noise in the Arctic to policies and management solutions for underwater noise and discuss whether Arctic-specific policies are necessary.},

	abstract = {This article evaluates Southall et al. (2007) in light of subsequent scientific findings and proposes revised noise exposure criteria to predict the onset of auditory effects in marine mammals. Estimated audiograms, weighting functions, and underwater noise exposure criteria for temporary and permanent auditory effects of noise are presented for six species groupings, including all marine mammal species. In-air criteria are also provided for amphibious species. Earlier marine mammal hearing groupings were reviewed and modified based on phylogenetic relationships and a comprehensive review of studies on hearing, auditory anatomy, and sound production. Auditory weighting functions are derived for each group; those proposed here are less flattened and closer to audiograms than the Southall et al. M-weightings. As in Southall et al., noise sources are categorized as either impulsive or non-impulsive, and criteria use multiple exposure metrics to account for different aspects of exposure. For continuous (non-impulsive) noise sources, exposure criteria are given in frequencyweighted sound exposure level ({SEL}, given in units relative to 1 μPa2-s or (20 μPa2)-s for water and air, respectively). Dual exposure metrics are provided for impulsive noise criteria, including frequency-weighted {SEL} and unweighted peak sound pressure level ({SPL}, given in units relative to 1 μPa or 20 μPa for water and air, respectively). Exposures exceeding the specified respective criteria level for any exposure metric are interpreted as resulting in predicted temporary threshold shift ({TTS}) or permanent threshold shift ({PTS}) onset. Scientific findings in the last decade provide substantial new insight but also underscore remaining challenges in deriving simple, broadly applicable quantitative exposure criteria for such diverse taxa. These criteria should be considered with regard to relevant caveats, recommended research, and with the expectation of subsequent revision.},

	abstract = {Beaked whales have mass stranded during some naval sonar exercises, but the cause is unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville’s beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2–3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2–3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 {dB} re 1 {mPa} by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.},

In this controlled sound exposure study, six narwhals were live-captured and instrumented with animal-borne tags providing movement and behavioural data, and exposed to concurrent ship noise and airgun pulses. All narwhals reacted to sound exposure with reduced buzzing rates, where the response was dependent on the magnitude of exposure defined as 1/distance to ship. Buzzing rate was halved at 12 km from the ship, and whales ceased foraging at 7–8 km. Effects of exposure could be detected at distances {\textgreater} 40 km from the ship.At only a few kilometres from the ship, the received high-frequency cetacean weighted sound exposure levels were below background noise indicating extreme sensitivity of narwhals towards sound disturbance and demonstrating their ability to detect signals embedded in background noise. The narwhal's reactions to sustained disturbance may have a plethora of consequences both at individual and population levels. The observed reactions of the whales demonstrate their auditory sensitivity but also emphasize, that anthropogenic activities in pristine narwhal habitats needs to be managed carefully if healthy narwhal populations are to be maintained.},

Here, we quantify the sound exposure levels recorded on acoustic tags attached to eight sperm whales at ranges between 1.4 and 12.6km from controlled air-gun array sources operated in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to multipath propagation, the animals were exposed to multiple sound pulses during each firing of the array with received levels of analyzed pulses falling between 131–167dB re. 1{μPa} (pp) [111–147dB re. 1{μPa} (rms) and 100–135dB re. 1{μPa}2s] after compensation for hearing sensitivity using the M-weighting. Received levels varied widely with range and depth of the exposed animal precluding reliable estimation of exposure zones based on simple geometric spreading laws. When whales were close to the surface, the first arrivals of air-gun pulses contained most energy between 0.3 and 3kHz, a frequency range well beyond the normal frequencies of interest in seismic exploration. Therefore air-gun arrays can generate significant sound energy at frequencies many octaves higher than the frequencies of interest for seismic exploration, which increases concern of the potential impact on odontocetes with poor low frequency hearing.},

	abstract = {Behavioral response studies provide significant insights into the nature, magnitude, and consequences of changes in animal behavior in response to some external stimulus. Controlled exposure experiments ({CEEs}) to study behavioral response have faced challenges in quantifying the importance of and interaction among individual variability, exposure conditions, and environmental covariates. To investigate these complex parameters relative to blue whale behavior and how it may change as a function of certain sounds, we deployed multi-s­ensor acoustic tags and conducted {CEEs} using simulated mid-f­requency active sonar ({MFAS}) and pseudo-r­andom noise ({PRN}) stimuli, while collecting synoptic, quantitative prey measures. In contrast to previous approaches that lacked such prey data, our integrated approach explained substantially more variance in blue whale dive behavioral responses to mid-f­requency sounds (r2 = 0.725 vs. 0.14 previously). Results demonstrate that deep-­feeding whales respond more clearly and strongly to {CEEs} than those in other behavioral states, but this was only evident with the increased explanatory power provided by incorporating prey density and distribution as contextual covariates. Including contextual variables increases the ability to characterize behavioral variability and empirically strengthens previous findings that deep-f­eeding blue whales respond significantly to mid-f­requency sound exposure. However, our results are only based on a single behavioral state with a limited sample size, and this analytical framework should be applied broadly across b­ ehavioral states. The increased capability to describe and account for individual response variability by including environmental variables, such as prey, that drive foraging behavior underscores the importance of integrating these and other relevant contextual parameters in experimental designs. Our results suggest the need to measure and account for the ecological dynamics of predator–prey interactions when studying the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in feeding animals.},

              Arctic marine mammals face a multitude of challenges linked to climate change, including increasing anthropogenic noise from ship traffic. The beluga whale (
              Delphinapterus leucas
              ), a predominately Arctic endemic cetacean, relies heavily on acoustic communication, with documented overlap between their vocalizations and hearing range and ship noise. Some belugas migrate through areas with the highest levels of ship traffic in the Pacific Arctic and exposure to ship noise is highly probable. Here, we document the responses of nine satellite‐tagged Eastern Beaufort Sea belugas to encounters with ships in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas during July–December 2018. We report 177 occasions when ships were within 125 km of tagged belugas and quantified changes in lateral and vertical movements to investigate individual behavioral responses to ship approaches within 50 km (
              n
               = 23). Belugas' swim speed was negatively correlated with ship distance, showing possible changes in swim speed up to 79 km away. Changes in lateral and vertical movements, indicating disruption of behavior, were observed when some ships passed within 50 km. These findings corroborate previous studies that have shown behavioral responses of belugas to ships at distances far beyond visual range, implying belugas react to low‐amplitude ship noise near ambient levels.},

	abstract = {Background: Continuous time movement models resolve many of the problems with scaling, sampling, and interpretation that affect discrete movement models. They can, however, be challenging to estimate, have been presented in inconsistent ways, and are not widely used.
Methods: We review the literature on integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity models and propose four fundamental correlated velocity movement models ({CVM}’s): random, advective, rotational, and rotational-advective. The models are defined in terms of biologically meaningful speeds and time scales of autocorrelation. We summarize several approaches to estimating the models, and apply these tools for the higher order task of behavioral partitioning via change point analysis.
Results: An array of simulation illustrate the precision and accuracy of the estimation tools. An analysis of a swimming track of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) illustrates their robustness to irregular and sparse sampling and identifies switches between slower and faster, and directed vs. random movements. An analysis of a short flight of a lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) identifies exact moments when switches occur between loopy, thermal soaring and directed flapping or gliding flights.
Conclusions: We provide tools to estimate parameters and perform change point analyses in continuous time movement models as an R package (smoove). These resources, together with the synthesis, should facilitate the wider application and development of correlated velocity models among movement ecologists.},

The continuous-time model was placed into a state–space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modiﬁcations which are possible.

	abstract = {Animal telemetry data are often analysed with discrete time movement models assuming rotation in the movement. These models are defined with equidistant distant time steps. However, telemetry data from marine animals are observed irregularly. To account for irregular data, a time-irregularised first-difference correlated random walk model with drift is introduced. The model generalizes the commonly used first-difference correlated random walk with regular time steps by allowing irregular time steps, including a drift term, and by allowing different autocorrelation in the two coordinates. The model is applied to data from a ringed seal collected through the Argos satellite system, and is compared to related movement models through simulations. Accounting for irregular data in the movement model results in accurate parameter estimates and reconstruction of movement paths. Measured by distance, the introduced model can provide more accurate movement paths than the regular time counterpart. Extracting accurate movement paths from uncertain telemetry data is important for evaluating space use patterns for marine animals, which in turn is crucial for management. Further, handling irregular data directly in the movement model allows efficient simultaneous analysis of several animals.},

	abstract = {Helical swimming is among the most common movement behaviors in a wide range of microorganisms, and these movements have direct impacts on distributions, aggregations, encounter rates with prey, and many other fundamental ecological processes. Microscopy and video technology enable the automated acquisition of large amounts of tracking data; however, these data are typically two-dimensional. The difﬁculty of quantifying the third movement component complicates understanding of the biomechanical causes and ecological consequences of helical swimming. We present a versatile continuous stochastic model—the correlated velocity helical movement ({CVHM}) model—that characterizes helical swimming with intrinsic randomness and autocorrelation. The model separates an organism’s instantaneous velocity into a slowly varying advective component and a perpendicularly oriented rotation, with velocities, magnitude of stochasticity, and autocorrelation scales deﬁned for both components. All but one of the parameters of the 3D model can be estimated directly from a two-dimensional projection of helical movement with no numerical ﬁtting, making it computationally very efﬁcient. As a case study, we estimate swimming parameters from videotaped trajectories of a toxic unicellular alga, Heterosigma akashiwo (Raphidophyceae). The algae were reared from ﬁve strains originally collected from locations in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans, where they have caused Harmful Algal Blooms ({HABs}). We use the {CVHM} model to quantify cell-level and strain-level differences in all movement parameters, demonstrating the utility of the model for identifying strains that are difﬁcult to distinguish by other means.},

The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random eﬀects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic diﬀerentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random eﬀects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using {ADMB} and {TMB} are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random eﬀects are a Gaussian random ﬁeld.

In both years all nine narwhals stayed within Melville Bay during the open-water portion of the tracking period. Most of the coastal positions obtained were inside the Melville Bay Wildlife Sanctuary. The narwhals also moved up to 100 km offshore to areas where water depths exceed 1000 m. There was no discernible relationship between tide and the movements of whales. By early to mid-October, the narwhals left Melville Bay and started migrating southwards along the continental slope, where water depths range from 500 to 1000 m. This southward movement ceased some 700 km farther south in late November, still in water with depths of 500–1000 m. The mean swimming speed of the whales during September varied between 2.9 and 8.2 km/h, calculated for intervals of 0.5–5 h between consecutive positions. No size- or sex-related pattern could be detected in swimming speeds, nor could any diurnal differences be found. The use of longer intervals between consecutive positions resulted in significantly lower calculated swimming speeds, suggesting that swimming speed will be underestimated if calculated over a longer time span. The mean swimming speed of one subadult and one adult male decreased significantly from 5.5 and 5.8 km/h in September to 2.7 km/h in November.},

We hypothesize that excessive hunting has affected life history and population dynamics of this population. Biological information and samples collected from the Inuit hunt, from satellite-tagged narwhals and from official hunters’ reports, were used to estimate age, growth, and reproduction. During 2007 through 2019, a decreasing proportion of young and increasing proportion of older whales were harvested. Male and female body length and male tusk length increased significantly, while body mass of both sexes showed a nonsignificant increase. The probability of catching a female decreased significantly, while a nonsignificant decline of catching a pregnant female was observed in both biological samples and hunters’ reports. Narwhal swimming speeds correlated with fluke widths indicated that larger whales attain greater speeds. The decline in juveniles and females is probably due to an opportunistic hunting practice targeting the easiest-to-catch whales, where bigger whales are faster and more difficult to catch. The cumulative effect of overharvest with a declining proportion of females, an overrepresentation of large males, and a lack of calves and juveniles has detrimental implications for this small narwhal population.},

Recent advancements address issues such as temporal autocorrelation and telemetry measurement error, but additional challenges remain. Difﬁculties introduced by complicated error structures or barriers to animal movement can weaken inference. We propose an approach for obtaining resource selection inference from animal location data that accounts for complicated error structures, movement constraints, and temporally autocorrelated observations. We specify a model for telemetry data observed with error conditional on unobserved true locations that reﬂects prior knowledge about constraints in the animal movement process. The observed telemetry data are modeled using a ﬂexible distribution that accommodates extreme errors and complicated error structures. Although constraints to movement are often viewed as a nuisance, we use constraints to simultaneously estimate and account for telemetry error. We apply the model to simulated data, showing that it outperforms common ad hoc approaches used when confronted with measurement error and movement constraints. We then apply our framework to an Argos satellite telemetry data set on harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Gulf of Alaska, a species that is constrained to move within the marine environment and adjacent coastlines.},

In this paper, we propose to use a higher order scheme to discretize the process and approximate the likelihood, such that the different time scales are appropriately accounted for. We show consistency and asymptotic normality with non-typical convergence rates. When only partial observations are available, we embed the approximation into a ﬁltering algorithm for the unobserved coordinates, and use this as a building block in a Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization algorithm.

            Background
            
              Animal-borne telemetry instruments (tags) have greatly advanced our understanding of species that are challenging to observe. Recently, non-recoverable instruments attached to cetaceans have increased in use, but these devices have limitations in data transmission bandwidth. We analyze trade-offs in the longevity, resolution, and continuity of data records from non-recoverable satellite-linked tags on deep-diving
              Ziphius cavirostris
              in the context of a behavioral response study of acute noise exposure. We present a strategic data collection programming scheme that balances resolution and continuity against longevity to address specific questions about the behavioral responses of animals to noise exposure in experimental contexts. We compare accuracy and precision between two programming regimes on a commercially available satellite-linked tag: (1) dive behavior summary defined by conductivity thresholds and (2) depth time-series at various temporal resolutions.
            
          
          
            Results
            We found that time-series data could faithfully replicate the more precisely defined dives from a dive summary record data stream to an acceptable error range for our application. We determined a 5-minute time-series data stream collected for 14 days balanced resolution with longevity, achieving complete or nearly complete diving records in 6 out of 8 deployments. We increased our data reception rate several fold by employing a boat based data capture system. Finally, a tag deployed in a group concurrently with a high resolution depth recorder showed high depth concordance.
          
          
            Conclusions
            We present the conceptual framework and iterative process for matching telemetry tag programming to research questions that we used and which should be applicable to a wide range of studies. Although designing new hardware for our specific questions was not feasible at the time, we were able to optimize the sampling regime of a commercially available instrument to meet the needs of our research questions and proposed analyses. Nevertheless, for other study species or designs, the complicated intersection between animal behavior and bandwidth of telemetry systems can often create a severe mismatch among research questions, data collection, and analysis tools. More flexible programming and purpose built instruments will increase the efficacy of these studies and increase the scientific yield relative to the inherently higher risk of invasive studies.},

	abstract = {The advent of {GPS} technology has made it possible to study human-wildlife interactions on large landscapes and quantify behavioral responses to recreation and other anthropogenic disturbances at increasingly fine scales. Of particular interest are the potential impacts on habitat use patterns, energetics, and cascading impacts on fecundity and other life history traits for key wildlife species that are exposed to human activities. Statistical models quantifying effects of human activity on animal movement on a heterogeneous landscape are essential for understanding these potential impacts. Here we present a statistical framework for analyzing movement data that is based on the concept of a potential surface. The potential surface is motivated by the assumption that animals are moving on a space-time surface with regions or points of attraction or of repulsion. We demonstrate the use of the technique by analyzing movement data from a long-term controlled experiment to evaluate the responses of free ranging Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) to anthropogenic disturbances that vary in time and space. Our results demonstrated a strong avoidance of elk to all-terrain vehicles detected up to one km from the disturbance. Elk avoidance of mountain bikers was detected up to 500 m, and avoidance of hikers and horseback riders was detected to 200 m.},

            Stochastic differential equations ({SDEs}) are popular tools to analyse time series data in many areas, such as mathematical finance, physics, and biology. They provide a mechanistic description of the phenomenon of interest, and their parameters often have a clear interpretation. These advantages come at the cost of requiring a relatively simple model specification. We propose a flexible model for {SDEs} with time-varying dynamics where the parameters of the process are nonparametric functions of covariates, similar to generalized additive models. Combining the {SDE} and nonparametric approaches allows for the {SDE} to capture more detailed, non-stationary, features of the data-generating process. We present a computationally efficient method of approximate inference, where the {SDE} parameters can vary according to fixed covariate effects, random effects, or basis-penalty smoothing splines. We demonstrate the versatility and utility of this approach with three applications in ecology, where there is often a modelling trade-off between interpretability and flexibility.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09574},
	abstract = {There is great interest in ecology to understand how wild animals are aﬀected by anthropogenic disturbances, such as sounds. For example, behavioural response studies are an important approach to quantify the impact of naval activity on marine mammals. Controlled exposure experiments are undertaken where the behaviour of animals is quantiﬁed before, during, and after exposure to a controlled sound source, often using telemetry tags (e.g., accelerometers, or satellite trackers). Statistical modelling is required to formally compare patterns before and after exposure, to quantify deviations from baseline behaviour. We propose varying-coeﬃcient stochastic diﬀerential equations ({SDEs}) as a ﬂexible framework to model such data, with two components: (1) time-varying baseline dynamics, modelled with non-parametric or random eﬀects of time-varying covariates, and (2) a non-parametric response model, which captures deviations from baseline. {SDEs} are speciﬁed in continuous time, which makes it straightforward to analyse data collected at irregular time intervals, a common situation for animal tracking studies. We describe how the model can be embedded into a state-space modelling framework to account for measurement error. We present inferential methods for model ﬁtting, model checking, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation (including on the response model). We apply this approach to two behavioural response study data sets on beaked whales: a satellite track, and highresolution depth data. Our results suggest that the whales’ horizontal movement and vertical diving behaviour changed after exposure to the sound source, and future work should evaluate the severity and possible consequences of these responses. These two very diﬀerent examples showcase the versatility of varying-coeﬃcient {SDEs} to measure changes in behaviour, and we discuss implications of disturbances for the whales’ energetic balance.},

Features of such data that make analysis particularly challenging include the presence of estimation errors that are non-Gaussian and vary in time, observations that occur irregularly in time, and complexity in the underlying behavioral processes. We develop a state–space framework that simultaneously deals with these features and demonstrate our method by analyzing three seal pathway data sets. We show how known information regarding error distributions can be used to improve inference of the underlying process(es) and demonstrate that our framework provides a powerful and ﬂexible method for ﬁtting different behavioral models to tracking data.},
