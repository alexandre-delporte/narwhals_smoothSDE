            Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are popular tools to analyse time series data in many areas, such as mathematical finance, physics, and biology. They provide a mechanistic description of the phenomenon of interest, and their parameters often have a clear interpretation. These advantages come at the cost of requiring a relatively simple model specification. We propose a flexible model for SDEs with time-varying dynamics where the parameters of the process are nonparametric functions of covariates, similar to generalized additive models. Combining the SDE and nonparametric approaches allows for the SDE to capture more detailed, non-stationary, features of the data-generating process. We present a computationally efficient method of approximate inference, where the SDE parameters can vary according to fixed covariate effects, random effects, or basis-penalty smoothing splines. We demonstrate the versatility and utility of this approach with three applications in ecology, where there is often a modelling trade-off between interpretability and flexibility.

Spatially and temporally explicit vector ﬁelds were estimated using approximating difference equations and nonparametric regression techniques. Estimated vector ﬁelds of movement were mapped onto the project area at selected times of the day to examine spatial patterns of movement in relation to topography. Using the concept of a potential function, we were able to study the inﬂuence of roads and grassland foraging areas on elk movements. Doing so we identiﬁed broad spatial patterns of elk movements and showed the time dependent effects of habitat features within the habitat mosaic at Starkey. Our analyses quantify the cycles of movements in spring and summer in terms of attraction or repulsion to speciﬁc habitat features, and illustrate the magnitude, timing and direction of these movements.

	abstract = {In view of the rapid extension of offshore wind farms, there is an urgent need to improve our knowledge on possible adverse effects of underwater sound generated by pile-driving. Mortality and injuries have been observed in fish exposed to loud impulse sounds, but knowledge on the sound levels at which (sub-)lethal effects occur is limited for juvenile and adult fish, and virtually non-existent for fish eggs and larvae. A device was developed in which fish larvae can be exposed to underwater sound. It consists of a rigid-walled cylindrical chamber driven by an electro-dynamical sound projector. Samples of up to 100 larvae can be exposed simultaneously to a homogeneously distributed sound pressure and particle velocity field. Recorded pile-driving sounds could be reproduced accurately in the frequency range between 50 and 1000 Hz, at zero to peak pressure levels up to 210 dB re 1mPa2 (zero to peak pressures up to 32 kPa) and single pulse sound exposure levels up to 186 dB re 1mPa2s. The device was used to examine lethal effects of sound exposure in common sole (Solea solea) larvae. Different developmental stages were exposed to various levels and durations of pile-driving sound. The highest cumulative sound exposure level applied was 206 dB re 1mPa2s, which corresponds to 100 strikes at a distance of 100 m from a typical North Sea pile-driving site. The results showed no statistically significant differences in mortality between exposure and control groups at sound exposure levels which were well above the US interim criteria for non-auditory tissue damage in fish. Although our findings cannot be extrapolated to fish larvae in general, as interspecific differences in vulnerability to sound exposure may occur, they do indicate that previous assumptions and criteria may need to be revised.},

	abstract = {One of the last pristine marine soundscapes, the Arctic, is exposed to increasing anthropogenic activities due to climate-induced decrease in sea ice coverage. In this study, we combined movement and behavioral data from animal-borne tags in a controlled sound exposure study to describe the reactions of narwhals, Monodon monoceros, to airgun pulses and ship noise. Sixteen narwhals were live captured and instrumented with satellite tags and Acousonde acoustic-behavioral recorders, and 11 of them were exposed to airgun pulses and vessel sounds. The sound exposure levels (SELs) of pulses from a small airgun (3.4 L) used in 2017 and a larger one (17.0 L) used in 2018 were measured using drifting recorders. The experiment was divided into trials with airgun and ship-noise exposure, intertrials with only ship-noise, and pre- and postexposure periods. Both trials and intertrials lasted ∼4 h on average per individual. Depending on the location of the whales, the number of separate exposures ranged between one and eight trials or intertrials. Received pulse SELs dropped below 130 dB re 1 µPa2 s by 2.5 km for the small airgun and 4–9 km for the larger airgun, and background noise levels were reached at distances of ∼3 and 8–10.5 km, respectively, for the small and big airguns. Avoidance reactions of the whales could be detected at distances {\textgreater}5 km in 2017 and {\textgreater}11 km in 2018 when in line of sight of the seismic vessel. Meanwhile, a ∼30\% increase in horizontal travel speed could be detected up to 2 h before the seismic vessel was in line of sight. Applying line of sight as the criterion for exposure thus excludes some potential pre-response effects, and our estimates of effects must therefore be considered conservative. The whales reacted by changing their swimming speed and direction at distances between 5 and 24 km depending on topographical surroundings where the exposure occurred. The propensity of the whales to move towards the shore increased with increasing exposure (i.e., shorter distance to vessels) and was highest with the large airgun used in 2018, where the whales moved towards the shore at distances of 10–15 km. No long-term effects of the response study could be detected.},

	abstract = {Behavioral response studies provide significant insights into the nature, magnitude, and consequences of changes in animal behavior in response to some external stimulus. Controlled exposure experiments (CEEs) to study behavioral response have faced challenges in quantifying the importance of and interaction among individual variability, exposure conditions, and environmental covariates. To investigate these complex parameters relative to blue whale behavior and how it may change as a function of certain sounds, we deployed multi-s­ensor acoustic tags and conducted CEEs using simulated mid-f­requency active sonar (MFAS) and pseudo-r­andom noise (PRN) stimuli, while collecting synoptic, quantitative prey measures. In contrast to previous approaches that lacked such prey data, our integrated approach explained substantially more variance in blue whale dive behavioral responses to mid-f­requency sounds (r2 = 0.725 vs. 0.14 previously). Results demonstrate that deep-f­eeding whales respond more clearly and strongly to CEEs than those in other behavioral states, but this was only evident with the increased explanatory power provided by incorporating prey density and distribution as contextual covariates. Including contextual variables increases the ability to characterize behavioral variability and empirically strengthens previous findings that deep-f­eeding blue whales respond significantly to mid-f­requency sound exposure. However, our results are only based on a single behavioral state with a limited sample size, and this analytical framework should be applied broadly across b­ ehavioral states. The increased capability to describe and account for individual response variability by including environmental variables, such as prey, that drive foraging behavior underscores the importance of integrating these and other relevant contextual parameters in experimental designs. Our results suggest the need to measure and account for the ecological dynamics of predator–prey interactions when studying the effects of anthropogenic disturbance in feeding animals.},

	abstract = {There is great interest in ecology to understand how wild animals are aﬀected by anthropogenic disturbances, such as sounds. For example, behavioural response studies are an important approach to quantify the impact of naval activity on marine mammals. Controlled exposure experiments are undertaken where the behaviour of animals is quantiﬁed before, during, and after exposure to a controlled sound source, often using telemetry tags (e.g., accelerometers, or satellite trackers). Statistical modelling is required to formally compare patterns before and after exposure, to quantify deviations from baseline behaviour. We propose varying-coeﬃcient stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) as a ﬂexible framework to model such data, with two components: (1) time-varying baseline dynamics, modelled with non-parametric or random eﬀects of time-varying covariates, and (2) a non-parametric response model, which captures deviations from baseline. SDEs are speciﬁed in continuous time, which makes it straightforward to analyse data collected at irregular time intervals, a common situation for animal tracking studies. We describe how the model can be embedded into a state-space modelling framework to account for measurement error. We present inferential methods for model ﬁtting, model checking, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation (including on the response model). We apply this approach to two behavioural response study data sets on beaked whales: a satellite track, and highresolution depth data. Our results suggest that the whales’ horizontal movement and vertical diving behaviour changed after exposure to the sound source, and future work should evaluate the severity and possible consequences of these responses. These two very diﬀerent examples showcase the versatility of varying-coeﬃcient SDEs to measure changes in behaviour, and we discuss implications of disturbances for the whales’ energetic balance.},

In this controlled sound exposure study, six narwhals were live-captured and instrumented with animal-borne tags providing movement and behavioural data, and exposed to concurrent ship noise and airgun pulses. All narwhals reacted to sound exposure with reduced buzzing rates, where the response was dependent on the magnitude of exposure defined as 1/distance to ship. Buzzing rate was halved at 12 km from the ship, and whales ceased foraging at 7–8 km. Effects of exposure could be detected at distances {\textgreater} 40 km from the ship.At only a few kilometres from the ship, the received high-frequency cetacean weighted sound exposure levels were below background noise indicating extreme sensitivity of narwhals towards sound disturbance and demonstrating their ability to detect signals embedded in background noise. The narwhal's reactions to sustained disturbance may have a plethora of consequences both at individual and population levels. The observed reactions of the whales demonstrate their auditory sensitivity but also emphasize, that anthropogenic activities in pristine narwhal habitats needs to be managed carefully if healthy narwhal populations are to be maintained.},

	title = {Trade-offs in telemetry tag programming for deep-diving cetaceans: data longevity, resolution, and continuity},
	abstract = {Background: Animal-borne telemetry instruments (tags) have greatly advanced our understanding of species that are challenging to observe. Recently, non-recoverable instruments attached to cetaceans have increased in use, but these devices have limitations in data transmission bandwidth. We analyze trade-oﬀs in the longevity, resolution, and continuity of data records from non-recoverable satellite-linked tags on deep-diving Ziphius cavirostris in the context of a behavioral response study of acute noise exposure. We present a strategic data collection programming scheme that balances resolution and continuity against longevity to address speciﬁc questions about the behavioral responses of animals to noise exposure in experimental contexts. We compare accuracy and precision between two programming regimes on a commercially available satellite-linked tag: (1) dive behavior summary deﬁned by conductivity thresholds and (2) depth time-series at various temporal resolutions.
Results: We found that time-series data could faithfully replicate the more precisely deﬁned dives from a dive summary record data stream to an acceptable error range for our application. We determined a 5-minute time-series data stream collected for 14 days balanced resolution with longevity, achieving complete or nearly complete diving records in 6 out of 8 deployments. We increased our data reception rate several fold by employing a boat based data capture system. Finally, a tag deployed in a group concurrently with a high resolution depth recorder showed high depth concordance.
Conclusions: We present the conceptual framework and iterative process for matching telemetry tag programming to research questions that we used and which should be applicable to a wide range of studies. Although designing new hardware for our speciﬁc questions was not feasible at the time, we were able to optimize the sampling regime of a commercially available instrument to meet the needs of our research questions and proposed analyses. Nevertheless, for other study species or designs, the complicated intersection between animal behavior and bandwidth of telemetry systems can often create a severe mismatch among research questions, data collection, and analysis tools. More ﬂexible programming and purpose built instruments will increase the eﬃcacy of these studies and increase the scientiﬁc yield relative to the inherently higher risk of invasive studies.},

In the design of a 5-year project in southern California (“SOCAL-BRS”), the development of a compact, hand-deployable, ship-powered, 15-element vertical line array sound source enabled a fundamental change in overall project conﬁguration from earlier efforts. The reduced size and power requirements of the sound source, which achieved relatively high output levels and directivity characteristics speciﬁed in the experimental design, enabled the use of substantially smaller research vessels. This size reduction favored a decentralization of ﬁeld effort, with greater emphasis on mobile small boat operations capable of covering large areas to locate and tag marine mammals. These changes in conﬁguration directly contributed to signiﬁcant increases in tagging focal animals and conducting sound exposure experiments. During ﬁeld experiments, received sound levels on tagged animals of several different species were within speciﬁed target ranges, demonstrating the efﬁcacy of these new solutions to challenging ﬁeld research problems.},

	abstract = {Beaked whales have mass stranded during some naval sonar exercises, but the cause is unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville’s beaked whales, Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect beaked whales when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of beaked whales to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions beaked whales stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, beaked whales were primarily detected near the periphery of the range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, beaked whales gradually filled in the center of the range over 2–3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2–3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of beaked whales to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The beaked whales reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 mPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by beaked whales in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance.},

	abstract = {Background: Continuous time movement models resolve many of the problems with scaling, sampling, and interpretation that affect discrete movement models. They can, however, be challenging to estimate, have been presented in inconsistent ways, and are not widely used.
Methods: We review the literature on integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck velocity models and propose four fundamental correlated velocity movement models (CVM’s): random, advective, rotational, and rotational-advective. The models are defined in terms of biologically meaningful speeds and time scales of autocorrelation. We summarize several approaches to estimating the models, and apply these tools for the higher order task of behavioral partitioning via change point analysis.
Results: An array of simulation illustrate the precision and accuracy of the estimation tools. An analysis of a swimming track of a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) illustrates their robustness to irregular and sparse sampling and identifies switches between slower and faster, and directed vs. random movements. An analysis of a short flight of a lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) identifies exact moments when switches occur between loopy, thermal soaring and directed flapping or gliding flights.
Conclusions: We provide tools to estimate parameters and perform change point analyses in continuous time movement models as an R package (smoove). These resources, together with the synthesis, should facilitate the wider application and development of correlated velocity models among movement ecologists.},

In addition, it oﬀers easy access to parallel computations. The user deﬁnes the joint likelihood for the data and the random eﬀects as a C++ template function, while all the other operations are done in R; e.g., reading in the data. The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random eﬀects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic diﬀerentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random eﬀects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random eﬀects are a Gaussian random ﬁeld. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org.},

	abstract = {Helical swimming is among the most common movement behaviors in a wide range of microorganisms, and these movements have direct impacts on distributions, aggregations, encounter rates with prey, and many other fundamental ecological processes. Microscopy and video technology enable the automated acquisition of large amounts of tracking data; however, these data are typically two-dimensional. The difﬁculty of quantifying the third movement component complicates understanding of the biomechanical causes and ecological consequences of helical swimming. We present a versatile continuous stochastic model—the correlated velocity helical movement (CVHM) model—that characterizes helical swimming with intrinsic randomness and autocorrelation. The model separates an organism’s instantaneous velocity into a slowly varying advective component and a perpendicularly oriented rotation, with velocities, magnitude of stochasticity, and autocorrelation scales deﬁned for both components. All but one of the parameters of the 3D model can be estimated directly from a two-dimensional projection of helical movement with no numerical ﬁtting, making it computationally very efﬁcient. As a case study, we estimate swimming parameters from videotaped trajectories of a toxic unicellular alga, Heterosigma akashiwo (Raphidophyceae). The algae were reared from ﬁve strains originally collected from locations in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Oceans, where they have caused Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). We use the CVHM model to quantify cell-level and strain-level differences in all movement parameters, demonstrating the utility of the model for identifying strains that are difﬁcult to distinguish by other means.},

Of particular interest are the potential impacts on habitat use patterns, energetics, and cascading impacts on fecundity and other life history traits for key wildlife species that are exposed to human activities. Statistical models quantifying effects of human activity on animal movement on a heterogeneous landscape are essential for understanding these potential impacts. Here we present a statistical framework for analyzing movement data that is based on the concept of a potential surface. The potential surface is motivated by the assumption that animals are moving on a space-time surface with regions or points of attraction or of repulsion. We demonstrate the use of the technique by analyzing movement data from a long-term controlled experiment to evaluate the responses of free ranging Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) to anthropogenic disturbances that vary in time and space. Our results demonstrated a strong avoidance of elk to all-terrain vehicles detected up to one km from the disturbance. Elk avoidance of mountain bikers was detected up to 500 m, and avoidance of hikers and horseback riders was detected to 200 m.},

	abstract = {This paper considers parameter estimation for continuous-time diffusion processes which are commonly used to model dynamics of financial securities including interest rates. To understand why the drift parameters are more difficult to estimate than the diffusion parameter, as observed in previous studies, we first develop expansions for the bias and variance of parameter estimators for two of the most employed interest rate processes, Vasicek and CIR processes. Then, we study the first order approximate maximum likelihood estimator for linear drift processes. A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed to correct bias for general diffusion processes with a theoretical justification. Simulation studies confirm the theoretical findings and show that the bootstrap proposal can effectively reduce both the bias and the mean square error of parameter estimates, for both univariate and multivariate processes. The advantages of using more accurate parameter estimators when calculating various option prices in finance are demonstrated by an empirical study.},

In both years all nine narwhals stayed within Melville Bay during the open-water portion of the tracking period. Most of the coastal positions obtained were inside the Melville Bay Wildlife Sanctuary. The narwhals also moved up to 100 km offshore to areas where water depths exceed 1000 m. There was no discernible relationship between tide and the movements of whales. By early to mid-October, the narwhals left Melville Bay and started migrating southwards along the continental slope, where water depths range from 500 to 1000 m. This southward movement ceased some 700 km farther south in late November, still in water with depths of 500–1000 m. The mean swimming speed of the whales during September varied between 2.9 and 8.2 km/h, calculated for intervals of 0.5–5 h between consecutive positions. No size- or sex-related pattern could be detected in swimming speeds, nor could any diurnal differences be found. The use of longer intervals between consecutive positions resulted in significantly lower calculated swimming speeds, suggesting that swimming speed will be underestimated if calculated over a longer time span. The mean swimming speed of one subadult and one adult male decreased significantly from 5.5 and 5.8 km/h in September to 2.7 km/h in November.},

,abstract = { A decreasing trend in narwhal (Monodon monoceros Linnaeus, 1758) abundance has been identified in a small population in Scoresby Sound, Southeast Greenland. We hypothesize that excessive hunting has affected life history and population dynamics of this population. Biological information and samples collected from the Inuit hunt, from satellite-tagged narwhals and from official hunters’ reports, were used to estimate age, growth, and reproduction. During 2007 through 2019, a decreasing proportion of young and increasing proportion of older whales were harvested. Male and female body length and male tusk length increased significantly, while body mass of both sexes showed a nonsignificant increase. The probability of catching a female decreased significantly, while a nonsignificant decline of catching a pregnant female was observed in both biological samples and hunters’ reports. Narwhal swimming speeds correlated with fluke widths indicated that larger whales attain greater speeds. The decline in juveniles and females is probably due to an opportunistic hunting practice targeting the easiest-to-catch whales, where bigger whales are faster and more difficult to catch. The cumulative effect of overharvest with a declining proportion of females, an overrepresentation of large males, and a lack of calves and juveniles has detrimental implications for this small narwhal population. },

We propose to use a higher order scheme to approximate the likelihood, such that the different timescales are appropriately accounted for. We show consistency and asymptotic normality with non-typical convergence rates. When only partial observations are available, we embed the approximation in a filtering algorithm for the unobserved co-ordinates and use this as a building block in a stochastic approximation expectation–maximization algorithm. We illustrate on simulated data from three models: the harmonic oscillator, the FitzHugh–Nagumo model used to model membrane potential evolution in neuroscience and the synaptic inhibition and excitation model used for determination of neuronal synaptic input.}",
